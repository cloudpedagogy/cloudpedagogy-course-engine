# v1.13.0 Absence Signals — Schema and Semantics

**Release:** v1.13.0  
**Status:** Design artefact (authoritative for v1.13)  
**Related:**
- `docs/acceptance/v1.13.0-acceptance_criteria.md`
- `docs/design/v1.13.0-design.md`

---

## Where this file belongs

Place this file at:

- `docs/design/v1.13.0-absence-signals.md`

This keeps all v1.13 design artefacts co-located and versioned.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **absence signalling** for v1.13.0 as a governance mechanism.

Signals are designed to:
- make **institutionally relevant absences** visible
- support review conversations and audit traceability
- remain **non-judgemental** and **non-blocking** by default

Signals are not designed to:
- assess quality
- declare compliance
- rank maturity
- prescribe remediation

This document is a **contract** for how signals behave and how they appear in artefacts.

---

## 2. Definition: What is an absence signal?

An **absence signal** is a structured, machine-readable statement that:

- identifies a **review-relevant gap** (something missing, thin, or contradictory)
- provides **inspectable evidence paths** for the reviewer
- frames the gap as a **prompt for human judgement**, not an engine judgement

Signals describe *review friction*, not wrongdoing.

---

## 3. Non-negotiables (v1.13)

Signals MUST adhere to the following constraints:

- **Non-blocking by default:** signals do not fail builds or validation.
- **No scoring:** no numeric scores, percentages, grades, or rankings.
- **No compliance claims:** signals never imply legal/ethical compliance status.
- **No recommendations:** signals may include review questions, not “do X” instructions.
- **Stable identifiers:** signal IDs are stable and suitable for dashboards/CI.

These constraints implement:
- AC-SIGNAL-001 → AC-SIGNAL-004
- AC-POLICY-001 → AC-POLICY-002

---

## 4. Signal severity semantics

v1.13 defines exactly two severities:

- `info` — a notable absence or omission that is likely relevant to review, but may be expected.
- `warning` — an absence that increases review friction or raises a defensibility question.

No other severities exist in v1.13 (e.g., no `error`, no `critical`).

**Important:** severity is not a judgement of quality; it is an indicator of *review attention*.

---

## 5. Signal schema (stable contract)

Signals are JSON-serialisable objects with the following fields.

### 5.1 Required fields

- `id` (string)  
  A stable identifier, e.g. `SIG-MAP-001`.

- `severity` (string enum)  
  One of: `info`, `warning`.

- `summary` (string)  
  One-line statement suitable for lists and dashboards.

- `detail` (string)  
  Short, committee-readable explanation (2–5 sentences).

- `evidence` (array of strings)  
  Machine-inspectable pointers to the relevant fields/paths that triggered the signal.

### 5.2 Optional fields

- `review_question` (string)  
  A neutral question to support committee discussion.

- `source` (string)  
  Where the signal was computed from, e.g. `course.yml`, `manifest.json`.  
  (Useful when signals can be produced in multiple contexts.)

- `tags` (array of strings)  
  Light categorisation (e.g. `["mapping", "intent"]`) for filtering.  
  Tags must be non-normative and non-judgemental.

### 5.3 Forbidden fields

The following MUST NOT appear in v1.13 signals:

- any numeric scoring fields (`score`, `percent`, `rating`, etc.)
- any compliance assertions (`compliant`, `non_compliant`, `meets_policy`, etc.)
- any prescriptive remediation fields (`recommended_action`, `fix`, `next_step`, etc.)
- any personal attribution (no authors, no blame)

---

## 6. Evidence path conventions

Evidence entries are strings that reference **specific declared fields**.

Minimum convention:

- `course.yml:<path>` — evidence derived from course configuration
- `manifest.json:<path>` — evidence derived from recorded artefacts

Examples:
- `course.yml:framework_alignment`
- `course.yml:capability_mapping`
- `course.yml:design_intent.ai_positioning`

Evidence is a pointer for inspection, not a proof claim.

---

## 7. Where signals appear (artefact placement)

Signals must appear in both:

### 7.1 `explain --json`
- Signals are the primary inspection surface.
- The `signals` key MUST exist even when empty.

### 7.2 `manifest.json`
- When the manifest is generated, computed signals must be recorded.
- Manifest signals represent the state **at artefact creation time**.

These rules implement:
- AC-SIGNAL-004
- AC-MANIFEST-001 → AC-MANIFEST-002

---

## 8. Lifecycle rules (immutability and recomputation)

### 8.1 Manifest signals are historical
Signals recorded in `manifest.json` are a snapshot of what the engine surfaced at that time.

They MUST NOT be retroactively modified.

### 8.2 Explain behaviour (preferred v1.13 posture)
- If a manifest exists, `explain` SHOULD surface the signals recorded in the manifest.
- If no manifest exists, `explain` MAY compute signals on demand.
- In either case, schema and meaning must match.

This supports stability and auditability without forcing manifest generation.

---

## 9. Initial v1.13 signal set (minimal)

v1.13 intentionally ships with a small set of high-value signals.

### SIG-INTENT-001 — Design intent missing
- **Severity:** `info`  
- **Condition:** `design_intent` is absent.
- **Rationale:** Intent is optional, but absence is often review-relevant.

Suggested review question:
- “Is design intent documented elsewhere, and should it be recorded here for traceability?”

Evidence:
- `course.yml:design_intent`

---

### SIG-MAP-001 — Alignment declared without capability mapping
- **Severity:** `warning`  
- **Condition:** framework alignment is declared, but capability mapping is missing.
- **Rationale:** Claims without inspectable mapping increase defensibility burden.

Suggested review question:
- “Is the alignment claim sufficiently evidenced for internal or external review?”

Evidence:
- `course.yml:framework_alignment`
- `course.yml:capability_mapping`

---

### SIG-MAP-002 — Capability mapping present but thin
- **Severity:** `warning`  
- **Condition:** capability mapping exists but is empty or contains only placeholders.
- **Rationale:** Thin mapping creates the appearance of evidence without substance.

Suggested review question:
- “Does the mapping contain enough inspectable detail to support the stated claim?”

Evidence:
- `course.yml:capability_mapping`

---

### SIG-AI-001 — AI discussed in intent without structural scoping metadata
- **Severity:** `info` (or `warning` if the intent includes consequential AI use)  
- **Condition:** design intent references AI use, but no scoping metadata is present.
- **Rationale:** Institutions need traceable boundaries around AI use, even if permissive.

Suggested review question:
- “Are the scope and boundaries of AI use clearly recorded for review and assurance?”

Evidence:
- `course.yml:design_intent`
- `course.yml:<ai_scoping_field(s)>` (exact path depends on current schema)

Note:
This signal may require finalisation once the exact scoping field name(s) are confirmed.

---

## 10. Implementation notes (non-binding)

This section is informational and does not override schema/semantics.

- Signals should be computed from the validated course model (post-schema validation).
- Use a single function to compute signals to ensure determinism.
- Prefer additive changes to explain JSON output (contract stability).

---

## 11. Change control

This document is authoritative for v1.13.

Any changes to signal schema, severity semantics, or lifecycle rules require:
- updating this file, and
- updating v1.13 acceptance criteria if necessary, and
- adding/adjusting contract tests.

End of design artefact.
