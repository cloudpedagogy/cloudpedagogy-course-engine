# v1.13.1 Lessons Learned — AI Scoping & Governance Signals

## Context

v1.13 introduced **absence signalling** as a governance feature, alongside a clearer separation between:

- **Declarative author intent** (what the course designer states)
- **Structural metadata** (what can be inspected and audited)
- **Policy interpretation** (how institutions choose to react)

v1.13.1 represents a stabilisation release focused on **AI scoping** — clarifying what belongs in the course specification, what belongs in the manifest, and what must *not* be inferred or enforced by the engine.

This document captures the key lessons learned during this iteration, for future design decisions.

## 1. SIG-AI-001 Was Correct — But Noisy

**Observation**
- The original signal `SIG-AI-001` (“AI positioning declared without structural scoping metadata”) correctly identified a *review-relevant gap*.
- However, in practice it triggered warnings even when authors had already provided rich, narrative AI guidance in `design_intent.ai_position`.

**Lesson**
- Signals that detect *absence* must be extremely conservative.
- Even well-intentioned review prompts can feel punitive if they fire too early or too often.

**Outcome**
- Structural AI scoping was introduced to make intent *explicit and inspectable*, eliminating the need for inference-based warnings in well-authored courses.

## 2. Structural AI Scoping Beats Inference Every Time

**Observation**
- Attempting to infer AI boundaries from prose (design intent, lesson text) is fragile and subjective.
- Inference creates disagreement: different reviewers will interpret the same prose differently.

**Lesson**
- Governance systems should prefer **explicit declaration over clever detection**.
- If something matters in review, it must have a structural home in the spec.

**Outcome**
- `ai_scoping` became a first-class, declarative block:
  - Human-authored
  - Non-enforcing
  - Manifest-recorded
  - Stable-hash auditable

---

## 3. Absence Signals Must Stay Minimal

**Observation**
- It is tempting to add more signals once the mechanism exists.
- However, too many signals quickly create “background noise” and erode trust.

**Lesson**
- Absence signals should:
  - Flag *only* high-value review risks
  - Never imply quality judgement
  - Never escalate by default

**Outcome**
- v1.13.1 keeps the signal set intentionally small.
- Presence of `ai_scoping` now suppresses unnecessary AI-related absence warnings.

## 4. Declarative ≠ Enforced (and That’s a Feature)

**Observation**
- Several failure modes emerged when structural metadata was treated as something to be “validated for correctness”.

**Lesson**
- The Course Engine must never decide whether AI use is *appropriate*.
- Its role is to make decisions *inspectable*, not *correct*.

**Outcome**
- AI scoping is:
  - Declared by authors
  - Recorded verbatim
  - Surfaceable to reviewers
  - Interpreted only by policy profiles (outside the core engine)

---

## 5. Manifest Is the Contract Surface

**Observation**
- Review, QA, and CI workflows operate on built artefacts, not source YAML.

**Lesson**
- If something matters for governance, it must appear in `manifest.json`.
- Build-time state is the authoritative record.

**Outcome**
- AI scoping presence and hash are persisted in the manifest.
- Signals represent **state at build time**, not live evaluation.

## 6. Design Insight: Signals vs Structure

A key architectural distinction emerged:

| Concern | Correct Mechanism |
|------|------------------|
| Author intent | Declarative spec fields |
| Review prompts | Absence signals |
| Enforcement | External policy profiles |
| Audit trail | Manifest hashes |
| Quality judgement | Human review |

Violating this separation increases institutional risk.

## Final Reflection

v1.13.1 reinforced a core CloudPedagogy principle:

> **Good governance tooling reduces ambiguity without reducing agency.**

By shifting AI scoping from inference to declaration, the Course Engine became:
- Quieter
- Clearer
- More defensible
- More institution-ready

This document should be revisited before introducing any new governance signals.
