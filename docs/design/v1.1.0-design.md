# Design Record: v1.1 – Capability Mapping Metadata

## Version
- **Release:** v1.1.0
- **Status:** Historical design record (active)

---

## Purpose

This document records the **design intent and architectural decisions** introduced in
**Course Engine v1.1.0**, which added *capability mapping metadata* to `course.yml`
and surfaced that metadata in `manifest.json`.

Capability mapping is a **governance-facing feature**, not a pedagogical enforcement mechanism.
Its role is to make *intent explicit*, *claims inspectable*, and *review conversations traceable*.

---

## Context

Prior to v1.1.0, Course Engine focused on deterministic compilation and reproducible artefacts.
Institutions required visibility into declared alignment with capability frameworks.

v1.1.0 introduces a **non-enforcing metadata layer** to support governance without altering builds.

---

## Design Goals

- Make intent explicit
- Remain non-enforcing
- Be framework-agnostic
- Preserve determinism
- Enable future governance tooling

---

## Scope (v1.1.0)

### Added
- Optional `capability_mapping` in `course.yml`
- Informational recording in `manifest.json`
- Inspection via `course-engine inspect`

### Not Added
- Validation or enforcement
- Scoring or quality judgements

---

## Determinism

Capability metadata does not affect outputs or introduce non-determinism.

---

## Forward Compatibility

This design underpins later features:
- v1.2 reporting
- v1.3 validation
- v1.5 policy explain
- v1.8 explainability

---

## Summary

v1.1.0 established capability mapping as **transparent, inspectable, and non-enforcing**,
preserving Course Engine’s core guarantees.
