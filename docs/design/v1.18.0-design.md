# Design Record: v1.18.0 — Governance Packs

## Version
- **Release:** v1.18.0
- **Status:** Active design record
- **Component:** `course-engine pack`

---

## Purpose

This document records the **design intent, scope, and constraints** introduced in
**Course Engine v1.18.0**, which adds **governance packs** as a first-class feature.

Governance packs provide a **facts-only, portable representation** of governance-relevant
information derived from an existing build artefact, without triggering new builds,
renders, validation, or interpretation.

This design record exists to explain **why governance packs exist**, **what they are and are not**,
and **how they align with the Course Engine’s broader governance-first architecture**.

---

## Problem Statement

Institutions frequently need to:

- review courses without access to the full build environment
- archive evidence for QA, accreditation, or audit
- share governance artefacts with reviewers who should not rebuild or revalidate content
- integrate course evidence into CI pipelines or documentation workflows

Prior to v1.18, this required:
- direct access to `dist/<course-id>` folders
- knowledge of internal file meanings
- rerunning commands in environments that may no longer exist

This created unnecessary coupling between **evidence consumption** and **tool operation**.

The design problem was therefore:

> How can governance-relevant facts be shared, archived, and reviewed **without**
> rebuilding content, reinterpreting policy, or transferring the full working environment?

---

## Design Goals

Governance packs were designed to:

1. Package **facts already computed** by the engine
2. Preserve **traceability back to `manifest.json`**
3. Support **institutional handover and audit**
4. Avoid introducing new interpretation or judgement
5. Remain deterministic and reproducible
6. Keep packaging **strictly separate** from build, render, and validation workflows

---

## Non-Goals

Governance packs were explicitly **not** designed to:

- re-run builds or renders
- evaluate pedagogical quality
- apply or enforce policies
- infer compliance or approval
- replace validation workflows
- generate new governance facts

Any feature that moved packs toward **interpretation or enforcement** was deliberately excluded.

---

## Architectural Placement

Governance packs sit **downstream of build** and **parallel to validation**.

They operate only on an existing artefact directory containing `manifest.json`.

This preserves the core separation:

- **Build** → computes facts
- **Manifest** → records evidence
- **Validate** → interprets facts via policy
- **Pack** → packages facts for external use

No new facts are computed during pack generation.

---

## Profile-Based Composition

From v1.18 onward, governance packs are controlled via an explicit `--profile` flag:

- `audit` (default): full governance context
- `qa`: reduced-scope pack for internal QA workflows
- `minimal`: lightweight summary-only pack

Profiles control **which artefacts are included**, not how facts are computed.

This ensures:

- identical governance facts across profiles
- different consumption contexts without duplication
- no hidden logic divergence between workflows

Invalid profile values are rejected at the CLI layer.

---

## Facts-Only Guarantee

A core design commitment of v1.18 is that governance packs are **facts-only**.

This means:

- all contents are derived from `manifest.json` or deterministic explain/report outputs
- no new interpretation is added
- no policy thresholds are applied
- no success/failure semantics are introduced

Each pack includes a generated `README.txt` that explicitly states:
- what the pack is for
- what it is not for
- which profile was used
- how the contents should be interpreted

This README is part of the governance surface.

---

## Non-Destructive Behaviour

Pack generation is non-destructive by default.

- Existing build artefacts are never modified
- Output directories require explicit `--overwrite`
- Pack generation can be repeated safely

This aligns with the Course Engine’s broader commitment to reversible, auditable workflows.

---

## Relationship to Validation and Explain

Governance packs deliberately **do not replace** validation or explain workflows.

- Validation remains the mechanism for **policy-based interpretation**
- Explain remains the mechanism for **policy resolution inspection**
- Packs are for **evidence packaging only**

This separation avoids collapsing governance **facts**, **interpretation**, and **decision-making**
into a single step.

---

## Governance and Assurance Rationale

From a governance perspective, v1.18 improves:

- **auditability**: evidence can be frozen and archived
- **reviewability**: reviewers do not need tool access
- **defensibility**: facts are preserved without reinterpretation
- **institutional trust**: scope and limits are explicit

Governance packs support assurance workflows **without automating approval**.

---

## Design Trade-Offs

Accepted trade-offs include:

- additional artefact type to document and support
- intentional lack of convenience features (e.g. auto-approval)
- requirement for users to understand pack scope

These trade-offs were accepted to preserve clarity, trust, and accountability.

---

## Relationship to Design Principles

Governance packs directly reflect core Course Engine principles:

- **Transparency over seamlessness**
- **Governance as a design requirement**
- **Non-destructive defaults**
- **Separation of concerns**
- **Human judgement remains central**

They extend the manifest-as-evidence model without altering its meaning.

---

## Stability and Evolution

The semantics of governance packs are expected to remain stable.

Future evolution may include:
- additional profiles
- additional deterministic artefacts
- improved documentation

Any change that introduces interpretation, enforcement, or judgement
would require an explicit design revision and governance review.

---

## Summary

v1.18.0 introduces governance packs as a **packaging layer for governance evidence**.

They do not change what the Course Engine knows.
They change **how that knowledge can be shared responsibly**.

This feature strengthens institutional usability while preserving the system’s
core commitments to transparency, accountability, and human judgement.
