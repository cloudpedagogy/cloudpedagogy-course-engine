# v1.18.0 — Governance Pack Profiles (Design Specification)

## Status
Draft (design contract)

## Purpose

This document defines **governance pack profiles** introduced in v1.18.0.

Pack profiles control **which existing artefacts are included** in a governance pack.
They **do not** alter:

- how artefacts are generated
- validation logic or thresholds
- capability mapping semantics
- policy interpretation
- enforcement behaviour

Profiles are **purely compositional**.

---

## Design Principles

- **Facts-only**: profiles never introduce new claims or interpretations
- **Deterministic**: the same inputs always produce the same pack contents
- **Explicit**: no guessing, no implicit behaviour
- **Backward-safe**: default behaviour matches v1.17 pack output

---

## Profiles

### 1. `minimal`

Intended for:
- lightweight sharing
- early-stage review
- attachment to informal documentation

Includes:
- `pack_manifest.json`
- `summary.txt`
- `README.txt`

Excludes:
- explain outputs
- reports
- validation artefacts
- build artefacts

---

### 2. `qa`

Intended for:
- internal quality assurance
- academic review panels
- curriculum approval workflows

Includes:
- everything in `minimal`
- `manifest.json` (if present)
- `explain.txt` (if present)
- `explain.json` (if present)
- `report.txt` / `report.json` (if present)
- `validate.txt` / `validate.json` (if present)

Notes:
- Report and validation outputs are included **only if they already exist**
- No new artefacts are generated to satisfy this profile

---

### 3. `audit` (default)

Intended for:
- formal audit
- external review
- accreditation
- long-term archiving

Includes:
- **all artefacts generated by `course-engine pack`**
- plus `README.txt`

This profile matches the full v1.17 pack behaviour, with the addition of the generated README.

---

## Default Behaviour

- If `--profile` is not specified, the engine uses `audit`
- Profile selection affects **inclusion only**
- Profile selection never changes generation order or artefact contents

---

## CLI Usage

```bash
course-engine pack ARTEFACT --profile minimal --out packs/
course-engine pack ARTEFACT --profile qa --out packs/
course-engine pack ARTEFACT --out packs/          # defaults to audit
```

---

## Validation Rules

- Unknown profile names MUST produce a clear, human-readable error
- Profiles MUST be resolved before any file copying occurs
- Output file ordering MUST be deterministic across runs

---

## Non‑Goals (Explicit)

v1.18 governance pack profiles do **not**:

- score courses
- judge pedagogical quality
- imply compliance or accreditation
- introduce new validation rules
- enforce institutional policy

---

## Rationale

Governance artefacts often travel independently of the system that generated them.
Profiles make packs easier to **apply at scale** without compromising credibility,
meaning, or trust.

This design preserves the Course Engine’s posture as a
**governance-grade curriculum evidence system**, not a decision-maker.
