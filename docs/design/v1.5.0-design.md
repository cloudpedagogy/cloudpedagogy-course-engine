# v1.5 Design — Policy Explainability & Governance Traceability

## Goal
Improve explainability, comparability, and governance traceability of validation
policies **without changing validation logic or outcomes**.

## Non-Goals
- No new validation rules
- No rule semantics changes
- No scoring, grading, or ranking
- No manifest schema changes
- No UI or dashboard features

## New CLI Capabilities

### 1. --explain --json
Machine-readable explanation of:
- policy source
- resolved profile
- inheritance / chain
- effective rules
- strict mode

No validation is performed.

### 2. policy diff
Compare two policies and show:
- added rules
- removed rules
- changed thresholds

Informational only.

### 3. Policy provenance surfacing
Optional metadata (owner, review_cycle, etc.) exposed via:
- --explain
- --explain --json

### 4. Validation context block
Validation output includes:
- policy source
- profile
- strict mode

No effect on pass/fail logic.

## Backward Compatibility
- v1.4 CLI continues to work unchanged
- Policies without provenance metadata remain valid
- Default behaviour remains v1.4-equivalent

## Out of Scope
Anything that changes validation behaviour or exit codes.
