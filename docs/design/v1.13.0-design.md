# v1.13.0 Design Record — CloudPedagogy Course Engine

**Release:** v1.13.0  
**Status:** Design record (authoritative)  
**Related:** `docs/acceptance/v1.13.0-acceptance_criteria.md`

---

## 1. Purpose of this document

This document records the **design intent, scope boundaries, and architectural decisions**
for **Course Engine v1.13.0**.

It exists to ensure that:
- implementation decisions remain aligned with governance goals
- future contributors understand *why restraint exists*
- v1.13 behaviour can be defended under institutional, QA, or audit scrutiny

This is a **design record**, not a feature description or user guide.

---

## 2. v1.13 design posture

v1.13 is a **deepening release**, not an expansion release.

It deliberately:
- strengthens inspectability
- surfaces absence without judgement
- stabilises contracts relied upon by institutions

It deliberately does **not**:
- add new automation pipelines
- introduce agentic or generative behaviour
- recommend pedagogical improvements
- infer quality, compliance, or maturity

This posture directly supports the non-negotiables defined in
Section 1 of the v1.13 acceptance criteria.

---

## 3. Governing design principles (v1.13)

The following principles guided all v1.13 design decisions.

### 3.1 Explicit over inferred  
If something matters institutionally, it must be:
- explicitly declared, or
- explicitly absent

No hidden inference is permitted.

### 3.2 Inspection over recommendation  
The engine may expose facts, structure, gaps, and contradictions.
It must never recommend what an institution *should* do.

### 3.3 Non-blocking by default  
Absence, uncertainty, or incompleteness are not failures.
They are signals for human review.

### 3.4 Committee readability  
All surfaced artefacts must be usable in:
- QA meetings
- Academic Boards
- audit and review contexts

These principles underpin all acceptance criteria.

---

## 4. Acceptance-criteria-driven design mapping

This section explains **how each acceptance-criteria cluster is realised in design**.

### 4.1 Explain contract stability  
**Related ACs:** AC-EXPLAIN-001 → AC-EXPLAIN-003

Design decisions:
- `explain --json` is treated as a **contractual interface**, not a convenience output.
- New v1.13 fields are additive only.
- No existing keys change semantics.
- Explain remains read-only and side-effect-free.

Rationale:
Institutions integrate explain output into dashboards, CI, and review workflows.
Contract instability undermines trust more than missing features.

---

### 4.2 Absence signalling as a governance object  
**Related ACs:** AC-SIGNAL-001 → AC-SIGNAL-004

Design decisions:
- Absence is surfaced as **signals**, not errors.
- Signals are first-class, structured objects.
- Signals describe *review friction*, not wrongdoing.
- Signals are visible even when empty (`signals: []`).

Signals are deliberately boring:
- no scoring
- no ranking
- no automatic remediation

Rationale:
Institutions fear unexplained failure more than imperfection.
Signals make gaps visible without forcing premature judgement.

---

### 4.3 Manifest as institutional memory  
**Related ACs:** AC-MANIFEST-001 → AC-MANIFEST-002

Design decisions:
- Signals are recorded in `manifest.json` at build time.
- The manifest represents a **historical snapshot**, not live reinterpretation.
- Past manifests are never retroactively altered.

Rationale:
Governance processes depend on traceability.
Manifests must support reconstruction of *what was known at the time*.

---

### 4.4 Design intent handling  
**Related ACs:** AC-INTENT-001 → AC-INTENT-003

Design decisions:
- `design_intent` remains optional and informational.
- No policy requires intent fields unless explicitly configured.
- Intent is surfaced for inspection, not validation.

Rationale:
Design intent supports transparency and review conversations.
It must not become a proxy for quality or compliance.

---

### 4.5 Policy interaction boundaries  
**Related ACs:** AC-POLICY-001 → AC-POLICY-002

Design decisions:
- Signals are structurally distinct from policy failures.
- Any escalation from signal to failure requires explicit policy configuration.
- Silent escalation is prohibited.

Rationale:
Policies are institutional choices.
The engine must not make those choices implicitly.

---

### 4.6 Backwards compatibility  
**Related ACs:** AC-COMPAT-001 → AC-COMPAT-002

Design decisions:
- Existing `course.yml` files remain valid.
- CLI behaviour remains predictable and quiet by default.
- v1.13 introduces no required migration steps.

Rationale:
Forced change erodes trust and adoption.
v1.13 must feel safe to adopt.

---

## 5. Explicit non-goals (v1.13)

The following are **explicitly out of scope** for v1.13:

- pedagogical recommendations
- content generation
- AI-driven decision-making
- workflow orchestration (e.g. n8n)
- scoring, grading, or maturity assessment
- LMS or Thinkific integration

These exclusions are intentional and documented to prevent scope drift.

---

## 6. Architectural boundaries reaffirmed

v1.13 reaffirms the architectural separation between:

- **Governance core** (this repository)
- **Future orbit tools** (design assistants, workflows, platforms)

Course Engine remains:
- declarative
- inspectable
- non-agentic
- boring by design

Future tools may:
- produce inputs consumed by Course Engine
- consume artefacts produced by Course Engine

Course Engine must never depend on them.

---

## 7. Release readiness criteria

v1.13 is considered design-complete when:

- all v1.13 acceptance criteria are met
- explain output remains contract-stable
- absence signalling is visible but non-punitive
- no generator or exporter logic has changed
- the system remains defensible under hostile questioning

If there is doubt, the release must be delayed.

---

## 8. Design record status

This document is:
- authoritative for v1.13
- binding for implementation decisions
- superseded only by a later versioned design record

End of design record.
