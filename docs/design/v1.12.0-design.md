# Design Record: v1.12.0 — Design Intent as a First-Class Governance Signal

## Version
- **Release:** v1.12.0
- **Status:** Active design record
- **Scope:** Course schema, manifest, and explainability layer
- **Compatibility:** Fully backward compatible with v1.11.0

---

## Purpose

This design record documents the rationale, intent, and architectural decisions behind **v1.12.0** of the CloudPedagogy Course Engine.

The primary goal of this release is to introduce **explicit design intent** as a *first‑class, inspectable governance signal* — without altering build behaviour, validation logic, or enforcement semantics.

v1.12.0 strengthens transparency and audit readiness by making *why* a course was designed in a particular way visible alongside *what* was produced.

---

## Problem Statement

Prior to v1.12.0, the Course Engine provided strong answers to:

- *What was built?* (outputs, structure, artefacts)
- *How was it built?* (manifest, provenance, determinism)
- *What claims are declared?* (framework alignment, capability mapping)

However, one important governance question remained implicit:

> **Why were these design choices made?**

In practice, this information often lives:
- in committee papers,
- in email threads,
- in external documentation,
- or solely in the author’s head.

This made downstream QA, review, and audit processes brittle, opaque, and difficult to reproduce.

---

## Design Goals

v1.12.0 introduces design intent with the following explicit goals:

1. **Make rationale explicit**
   - Capture author-declared reasoning, context, and constraints.

2. **Remain non-enforcing**
   - Design intent must never block builds or validation.
   - It is informational, not normative.

3. **Preserve determinism**
   - No runtime dependencies.
   - Stable hashing for audit and change detection.

4. **Support governance workflows**
   - Enable inspection without reading lesson content.
   - Surface intent consistently in explain outputs.

5. **Avoid schema disruption**
   - Optional fields only.
   - No breaking changes to existing courses.

## Key Design Decision: `design_intent` Block

### Location

- Defined at the **top level of `course.yml`**
- Parallel to (but distinct from):
  - `framework_alignment`
  - `capability_mapping`

### Nature

- Optional
- Informational
- Human-authored (not machine-generated by default)

### Conceptual Role

| Signal type | Answers |
|------------|---------|
| `framework_alignment` | *Which frameworks does this course claim alignment with?* |
| `capability_mapping` | *Where is coverage and evidence declared?* |
| `design_intent` | *Why was the course designed this way?* |

---

## Manifest Representation

Design intent is recorded in `manifest.json` with the following properties:

- `present`: boolean
- `hash_sha256`: stable hash of the design intent content
- `summary`: short human-readable description

This ensures:

- **Auditability** — intent changes can be detected without diffing content
- **Explainability** — surfaced consistently via tooling
- **Non-intrusiveness** — lesson content remains opaque unless explicitly inspected

Manifest schema version is bumped to **1.3.0** to reflect this addition.

---

## Explainability Integration

### JSON Explain Output

- Design intent appears as a **top-level governance signal** in explain payloads.
- Stable, machine-readable, and CI-safe.

### Text Explain Output

- Design intent is surfaced under **“Governance Signals”**
- Includes:
  - presence
  - hash
  - truncated summary

This ensures parity between human-readable and machine-readable explain modes.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

v1.12.0 does **not**:

- Enforce or validate design intent content
- Interpret or score pedagogical quality
- Infer intent from lesson materials
- Replace institutional approval or QA processes
- Introduce policy rules based on intent

Design intent is *declared*, not *judged*.

---

## Behaviour Guarantees

- No change to build artefacts
- No change to rendering outputs
- No new validation failures
- No policy enforcement introduced
- Safe for CI, QA, and automation contexts

---

## Governance Positioning

Design intent complements existing governance signals by:

- Providing narrative context alongside structural claims
- Supporting review conversations without content inspection
- Enabling longitudinal tracking of course evolution

It is intentionally lightweight, optional, and human-centred.

---

## Summary

v1.12.0 marks a shift from **implicit rationale** to **explicit, inspectable design intent**.

This release strengthens the Course Engine’s position as a governance‑credible system by acknowledging that:

> Transparent systems must explain not only *what* they do, but *why* they were designed that way.

Design intent formalises that explanation — safely, conservatively, and without enforcement.
