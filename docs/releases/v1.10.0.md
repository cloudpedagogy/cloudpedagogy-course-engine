# Release Notes — v1.10.0

## Release Summary

v1.10.0 is a **stabilisation and interface-hardening release**.

It formalises the explainability interface, clarifies CLI semantics, and establishes
deterministic, governance-safe behaviour suitable for CI, QA, and institutional review
contexts.

This release introduces **no breaking changes**.

---

## What’s New

### Explain Interface Stabilisation
- Explain output semantics are now explicitly defined and contract-stable
- Explain behaviour is safe for automated consumers and governance workflows

### Output Format Selection
- Introduced `--format json|text` as the **preferred mechanism**
- Retained `--json` for backward compatibility

### Flag Precedence (Now Explicit)
- `--format` takes precedence over all other format indicators
- JSON is the default when no format flag is supplied
- `--json` is ignored if `--format` is explicitly provided

---

## Behavioural Guarantees

- Explain output structure is deterministic
- Schema and field meanings are stable
- Timestamps and runtime paths may vary (documented and expected)

---

## Backward Compatibility

- No existing commands are broken
- Legacy scripts using `--json` continue to work unchanged
- No changes to build or inspect behaviour

---

## What Did *Not* Change

- No new explain features
- No enforcement or validation added
- No policy or capability scoring
- No changes to course compilation outputs

---

## Who This Release Is For

This release is especially relevant for:
- CI/CD integrations
- QA and audit workflows
- Governance and review processes
- Institutions embedding Course Engine in regulated contexts
