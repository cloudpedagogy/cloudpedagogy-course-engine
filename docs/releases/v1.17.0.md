# Course Engine v1.17.0 — Workflow Hardening & Governance Pack Finalisation

**Release type:** Minor (non-breaking)  
**Focus:** Usability, workflow reliability, and governance artefact handling  
**Audience:** End users, maintainers, QA and governance stakeholders  

---

## Overview

v1.17.0 is a **workflow hardening and ergonomics release**.

It introduces **no schema changes, no new validation rules, and no enforcement behaviour**.

Instead, this release focuses on:
- making governance pack generation robust and unambiguous,
- aligning the CLI with real-world user workflows, and
- improving scriptability and CI integration without altering the engine’s governance posture.

All existing courses, manifests, and policies remain fully compatible.

---

## What’s new

### 1. Governance pack command finalised (`course-engine pack`)

The `pack` command is now production-ready and stable.

It generates a **facts-only governance pack** containing:
- `explain.json` and `explain.txt`
- `summary.txt`
- `manifest.json` (copied when packing from a built artefact)
- optional capability coverage reports (when capability mapping is present)
- a machine-readable `pack_manifest.json` describing inputs and contents

The pack command:
- never builds or renders content
- never enforces policies
- never evaluates pedagogical quality

It is intended for **QA review, audit, assurance, and evidence exchange**.

---

### 2. Artefact auto-detection for common workflows

From v1.17 onward, `course-engine pack` accepts:

- a direct artefact directory containing `manifest.json`, **or**
- a parent output directory **if it contains exactly one artefact subdirectory**

This matches common user behaviour (e.g. pointing at `dist/`) while preserving
deterministic and unambiguous governance output.

If multiple candidate artefacts are found, the engine fails with a **clear,
human-readable error** listing the detected options.

No guessing or silent assumptions are introduced.

---

### 3. Explicit artefact path emission on build

On successful build, the engine now prints the resolved artefact path:

```
ARTEFACT=dist/<course-id>
```

This small change significantly improves:
- scripting and automation
- CI/CD pipelines
- downstream use of `explain`, `validate`, and `pack`

The artefact path is now trivially reusable without path reconstruction or inspection.

---

## What has *not* changed

This release intentionally does **not** change:

- course schema or authoring rules
- manifest structure
- capability mapping behaviour
- governance signals or policy interpretation
- validation semantics
- explainability contracts

v1.17 reinforces existing design principles rather than extending them.

---

## Why this release matters

Institutions adopting Course Engine often move quickly from:
- individual authoring → QA → governance review → automation

v1.17 reduces friction at that transition point by:
- making artefact boundaries explicit,
- stabilising governance pack outputs, and
- improving integration into scripted and institutional workflows.

All without increasing enforcement or constraining academic practice.

---

## Compatibility & upgrade notes

- Fully backward compatible with all v1.x courses
- No migration steps required
- Existing demo courses and policies continue to work unchanged

---

## Verification

This release has been verified using:
- full test suite execution
- end-to-end demo course builds
- governance pack generation from artefact and parent output directories
- explain, inspect, report, and validate sanity checks

Maintainers should run `scripts/verify-release.sh` prior to tagging.

---

## Summary

v1.17.0 completes the **governance pack workflow** and improves
day-to-day usability without altering Course Engine’s governance contract.

It is a stability and readiness release, intended to support
real-world institutional adoption with confidence.
