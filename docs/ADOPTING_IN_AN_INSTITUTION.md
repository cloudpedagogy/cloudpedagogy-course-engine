# Adopting Course Engine in an Institution

> Applies to Course Engine v1.15+.  
> Purpose: provide a practical adoption pathway for higher education / public-sector governance contexts.

## What Course Engine is (and is not)
- Computes inspectable facts about a course build.
- Surfaces declared intent and metadata.
- Does not enforce pedagogical quality or institutional approval decisions.

## Recommended lifecycle usage (informational)
- draft → review → approved → published → archived

## Roles and responsibilities
### Course author / module lead
### QA / programme review lead
### Maintainer / platform owner

## Routine operational workflow (recommended)
1) Build
2) Smoke test
3) Explain summary
4) Validate (advisory)
5) Share artefacts + manifest

## Smoke tests vs verify-release
- Smoke tests: local confidence during authoring
- Verify-release: maintainer-only release assurance

## Policy usage (how strictness should evolve)
- Early adoption: advisory and transparent
- Later: formal profiles, still non-enforcing

## What not to automate
- Do not auto-approve based on validation output
- Do not auto-block publication purely from policy warnings
- Do not replace human QA judgement with “scores”

- Example commands
- Example outputs
