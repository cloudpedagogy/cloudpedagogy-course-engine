# v1.13.0 Acceptance Criteria — CloudPedagogy Course Engine

This document defines the **formal acceptance criteria** for **Course Engine v1.13.0**.

v1.13 is a *deepening* release. Its purpose is to strengthen governance robustness,
inspectability, and institutional trust — **not** to expand features, automation,
or pedagogical capability.

Acceptance criteria are written to be **testable**, **boring**, and **defensible**.

---

## 1. Release posture (non-negotiable)

v1.13 **must** satisfy all of the following:

- The engine remains a **governance-grade inspection system**, not a course builder.
- No new agentic, generative, or workflow behaviour is introduced.
- No feature introduces implicit judgement, scoring, ranking, or compliance claims.
- All new behaviour is **explicit, inspectable, and optional**.
- Existing valid projects must continue to build without modification.

If any criterion below conflicts with these principles, the criterion is invalid.

---

## 2. Explain contract stability

### AC-EXPLAIN-001 — Stable JSON surface
- `course-engine explain --json` MUST emit a **stable, versioned JSON structure**.
- New fields MAY be added, but existing fields MUST NOT change meaning.
- The presence of new v1.13 features MUST NOT require consumers to update immediately.

### AC-EXPLAIN-002 — Deterministic output
- Given identical inputs, `explain --json` output MUST be byte-for-byte stable
  (excluding timestamps or paths explicitly marked as non-deterministic).

### AC-EXPLAIN-003 — Read-only semantics
- `explain` MUST NOT modify project files, manifests, or build artefacts.
- `explain` MUST remain safe for CI, dashboards, and audit use.

---

## 3. Absence signalling (core v1.13 capability)

### AC-SIGNAL-001 — Signals exist as first-class objects
- v1.13 MUST introduce **absence signals** as explicit, structured objects.
- Signals MUST be informational or advisory only.
- Signals MUST NOT imply error, failure, or wrongdoing.

### AC-SIGNAL-002 — Non-blocking by default
- Absence signals MUST NOT fail builds or validation by default.
- No signal may change exit codes unless an explicit, opt-in policy requires it.

### AC-SIGNAL-003 — Stable signal schema
Each signal MUST include, at minimum:
- a stable `id`
- a `severity` (`info` or `warning`)
- a short `summary`
- a human-readable `detail`
- machine-inspectable `evidence` (paths / fields)

Signal schema MUST be documented and version-stable.

### AC-SIGNAL-004 — Explain visibility
- All emitted signals MUST appear in `explain --json`.
- If no signals exist, an empty array MUST still be present.

---

## 4. Manifest integration (institutional memory)

### AC-MANIFEST-001 — Signals recorded in manifest
- When a manifest is generated, all computed signals MUST be recorded in `manifest.json`.
- Signals in the manifest represent the **state at build time**, not live inference.

### AC-MANIFEST-002 — No retroactive inference
- The engine MUST NOT retroactively alter or reinterpret historical manifests.
- Signals are contextual to the artefact that produced them.

---

## 5. Design intent handling

### AC-INTENT-001 — Informational only
- `design_intent` fields remain **optional and non-validating**.
- No policy may require design intent unless explicitly configured by the user.

### AC-INTENT-002 — No implicit correctness
- The presence or absence of design intent MUST NOT be interpreted as quality,
  compliance, or maturity.

### AC-INTENT-003 — Explain surface
- When present, design intent MUST be surfaced in `explain` output
  in a form readable by governance and QA audiences.

---

## 6. Policy interaction

### AC-POLICY-001 — Signals ≠ policy failures
- Signals MUST be clearly distinguishable from policy validation failures.
- Policies MAY reference signals, but MUST NOT silently convert them into errors.

### AC-POLICY-002 — Explicit escalation only
- Any policy that escalates a signal to a failure MUST do so explicitly and visibly
  in configuration.

---

## 7. Backwards compatibility

### AC-COMPAT-001 — Existing examples still pass
- All existing example courses and demos MUST continue to build successfully.
- No required changes to `course.yml` are permitted for v1.13 adoption.

### AC-COMPAT-002 — CLI behaviour stability
- Existing CLI commands MUST continue to behave as documented.
- New output MUST NOT introduce noisy or surprising default behaviour.

---

## 8. Testing requirements

### AC-TEST-001 — Contract tests
- Tests MUST assert the presence and shape of the `signals` field in explain JSON.
- Tests MUST assert non-blocking behaviour by default.

### AC-TEST-002 — Determinism tests
- Tests MUST verify deterministic signal generation for identical inputs.

---

## 9. Documentation requirements

### AC-DOC-001 — Design record
- A `v1.13.0-design.md` document MUST explain:
  - why signals exist
  - why they are non-blocking
  - how they support governance and QA

### AC-DOC-002 — No marketing language
- Documentation MUST avoid promotional, persuasive, or compliance-claim language.
- Tone MUST remain factual and institutional.

---

## 10. Release gate (final check)

v1.13 may be released **only if**:

- All acceptance criteria above are met
- No generator, exporter, or template logic was altered
- The system remains boring, predictable, and defensible under scrutiny

If there is doubt, the release is **not ready**.
