          knowledge_check:
            question: "Which domain focuses most directly on governance?"
            options:
              - "Awareness"
              - "Decision-Making & Governance"
              - "Reflection, Learning & Renewal"
            answer: "Decision-Making & Governance"
            rationale: |
              Governance sits most directly in Decision-Making & Governance, even though other domains contribute.

          reflection_prompt: |
            Where in your current work would a capability lens reduce risk or improve clarity?

          instructor_notes: |
            Emphasise that governance is not a 'policy afterthought' — it shapes design choices from the start.
