    # v1.13: policy-driven handling of governance "absence signals"
    # - Signals are computed by the engine (informational by default)
    # - Policy chooses whether each signal should be ignored / info / warn / error
    signals:
      # One of: ignore | info | warn | error
      # Backwards-compatible default: warn (does not fail builds)
      default_action: "warn"

      # Optional per-signal overrides (only applies if the signal exists)
      overrides:
        SIG-INTENT-001: "warn"        # Design intent not declared (example: keep as warn in baseline)
        SIG-FRAMEWORK-001: "warn"     # Missing framework_alignment (future example)
        SIG-ASSESS-001: "warn"        # Missing assessment signals (future example)
        SIG-ATTR-001: "warn"          # Missing attribution/citations (future example)

      # Optional list of signal IDs to suppress entirely
