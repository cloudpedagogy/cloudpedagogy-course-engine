  language: "en-GB"

design_intent:
  summary: >
    This course is designed to support critical engagement with AI-informed
    environmental scanning and scenario planning practices while preserving
    human judgement, clear decision boundaries, and transparent design rationale.

  ai_position:
    assessments: >
      Generative AI tools may be used for formative exploration and drafting,
      but students should follow module and programme guidance for what is
      permitted in summative assessment. Where AI is used, students should be
      able to describe and reflect on their process.

    learning_activities: >
      AI tools are introduced as optional supports for analysis, ideation, and
      scenario exploration. Learners are encouraged to evaluate outputs critically,
      check assumptions, and surface limitations, bias, and uncertainty.

  roles_and_responsibilities:
    module_organiser: >
      Maintain clarity of the course’s AI position and design intent, ensure
      consistency across student-facing surfaces (e.g. handbook, LMS, briefs),
      and review this intent as part of annual module evaluation.
    tutor: >
      Reinforce appropriate AI use boundaries, support reflective discussion,
      and help learners distinguish between tool assistance and academic judgement.
    marker: >
      Assess learning outcomes, reasoning, and evidence of critical engagement,
      not the sophistication of tool use.

      alignment_type: "informational"
      notes: >
        Used as a reflective lens for course design and learning activities;
        it is not enforced for compliance and does not imply quality approval.

  policy_context:

      url: "https://example.org/ai-guidance"
      notes: >
        Referenced to support consistent messaging and expectations. The Course Engine
        does not interpret or enforce policy; it only surfaces declared context.

  review_and_evolution:
    last_reviewed: "2026-01-20"
    review_cycle: "annual"
    reflection_prompt: >
      What has changed this year in how AI influences teaching, learning, or assessment
      decisions in this course, and what updates to design intent or guidance are needed?

# -------------------------
ai_scoping:
  scope_summary: >
    AI tools may be used to support learning activities (e.g., scanning, synthesis,
    ideation, scenario exploration) and formative drafting. Use in summative assessment
    is governed by programme/module rules; where allowed, learners must disclose and
    be able to explain how AI contributed.

  # IMPORTANT: must be a YAML LIST (not a mapping)
  permitted_uses:
    - "Learning activities: optional support for scanning, synthesis, ideation, and scenario exploration."
    - "Formative drafting: outlines, early drafts, alternative framings, and planning support."
    - "Study support: practice questions, concept clarification, and reflective prompts (no private data)."
    - "Tutor support (staff): preparing workshop prompts, alternative examples, and draft feedback phrasing."

  # Also a list
  not_permitted:
    - "Summative assessment: generating final answers where policy does not permit AI use."
    - "Misrepresentation: presenting AI-generated work as wholly original without required disclosure."
    - "Sensitive data: entering personal, confidential, or restricted information into third-party tools."

  disclosure_expectations: >
    Where AI use is permitted, learners should be able to describe the tool(s) used,
    the prompts/inputs at a high level, what was accepted/changed/rejected, and why.

  data_handling: >
    Do not paste personal, confidential, or identifiable data into AI tools unless an
    institutionally approved service is explicitly designated for that purpose.

  decision_boundaries: >
    AI outputs must not be treated as authoritative. Learners are expected to verify
    claims, check sources, and apply academic and professional judgement.
