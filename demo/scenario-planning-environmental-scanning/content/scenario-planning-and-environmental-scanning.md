# AI Tools for Real-Time Environmental Scanning

## **Introduction** 

In rapidly evolving higher education landscapes, the ability to detect, interpret, and respond to change is a strategic necessity. Real-time environmental scanning, once a manual and resource-intensive process, can now be augmented by generative AI assistants capable of synthesising global signals, interpreting weak trends, and supporting adaptive decision-making. This lesson explores how AI tools can enhance institutional intelligence by enabling continuous awareness of emerging developments—across policy, technology, demographics, and global events—and transforming this awareness into actionable strategic insight.

## Understanding Environmental Scanning in the AI Era

Environmental scanning refers to the systematic exploration of external and internal factors that may affect an institution’s future trajectory. Traditionally, this involves monitoring sources such as policy documents, research reports, market analyses, and sector news. However, the exponential pace and scale of change—particularly in AI, climate policy, and digital education—demand a more dynamic and continuous form of intelligence gathering.

Generative AI systems can now act as partners in this process, performing not only information retrieval but also early pattern detection, cross-domain synthesis, and meaning-making. By framing scanning as an iterative dialogue rather than a one-off report, AI assistants help leaders and analysts maintain situational awareness without succumbing to information overload.

For higher education institutions, this translates into a living dashboard of insight. AI can track topics like policy reform in student data governance, geopolitical risks affecting research collaborations, or shifts in graduate employability trends. The result is not simply faster information flow but a qualitatively different kind of institutional cognition—more anticipatory, interconnected, and reflective.

## From Data Streams to Insight: The Role of Generative AI

Generative AI extends traditional business intelligence by offering interpretive and creative capacities. Instead of static dashboards, institutions can now engage conversationally with their environmental data:

- **Summarisation and sense-making:** AI assistants can condense large volumes of sector reports or policy announcements into thematic summaries, highlighting implications for teaching, research, or funding.

- **Pattern recognition and clustering:** By analysing multiple inputs—social media, research databases, news feeds—AI can surface recurring patterns and link them to institutional priorities.

- **Contextual scenario prompts:** When scanning detects a new signal (e.g., rise of microcredential frameworks), AI can prompt leaders to explore potential futures or responses.

- **Real-time monitoring:** Through API connections or automation tools, institutions can maintain live feeds that track emerging keywords or issues relevant to their strategic domains.

Crucially, human oversight remains essential. AI can generate plausible narratives, but these must be validated through expert review, stakeholder consultation, and critical reflection. The goal is not to replace human judgement but to augment it with real-time interpretive capability.

## Designing a Real-Time Scanning Workflow

A practical workflow for AI-augmented environmental scanning might include:

1.  **Define scanning domains:** Identify categories such as policy, pedagogy, technology, demographics, funding, and sustainability.

2.  **Automate data gathering:** Use AI agents to collect content from open data sources (e.g., government consultations, sector think tanks, social media trends, preprint repositories).

3.  **Apply generative summarisation:** Prompt an AI assistant to generate daily or weekly briefs summarising key developments in each domain.

4.  **Classify signals:** Ask the AI to label findings as *strong signals* (well-evidenced trends) or *weak signals* (emerging uncertainties).

5.  **Generate interpretive prompts:** Use AI to suggest reflective questions such as “How might this affect postgraduate recruitment?” or “What capabilities would our staff need under this scenario?”

6.  **Validate and visualise:** Human analysts review AI outputs, cross-check facts, and use visual dashboards to track shifts over time.

This design transforms environmental scanning into a semi-automated, continuously learning process—sensitive to nuance, yet efficient enough to inform strategic conversations.

## Applied Scenarios in Higher Education

**Scenario 1: Policy Change Detection**
A university strategy unit configures its AI assistant to monitor government consultation websites and higher education funding bodies. When new discussions about AI regulation in assessment appear, the assistant summarises the key proposals, compares them with existing institutional policies, and highlights potential compliance risks. The leadership team uses this insight to prepare a proactive briefing for the academic board.

**Scenario 2: Technology Adoption Tracking**  
A learning innovation team deploys a generative AI model to scan patent filings, edtech blogs, and investment trends. The AI identifies the rising use of multimodal learning analytics tools. Instead of reacting late to this trend, the institution begins internal trials and develops a responsible adoption framework aligned with its data ethics policy.

**Scenario 3: Global Risk Monitoring**  
A research office uses AI to aggregate geopolitical signals related to research funding and visa policy. The system detects early warnings about tightening collaborations in certain regions and alerts deans of research to diversify partnerships and strengthen risk mitigation measures.

Across all scenarios, the human role remains interpretive—reviewing AI insights, debating implications, and aligning institutional response with mission and values.

**Strengths and Limitations of AI Scanning**

AI-assisted scanning offers several advantages:

- **Speed and scale:** AI can process far more information than any human team, maintaining continuous coverage of relevant sources.

- **Pattern integration:** By synthesising across domains, AI helps connect developments that might otherwise remain siloed.

- **Prompted reflection:** Well-designed AI workflows can spark strategic dialogue rather than passive consumption of reports.

However, limitations must be acknowledged:

- **Data bias and blind spots:** AI reflects the data it consumes; underrepresentation of certain regions or disciplines can skew insight.

- **Overconfidence in generated summaries:** AI may produce fluent but inaccurate statements, requiring critical human verification.

- **Ethical and governance challenges:** Institutions must ensure compliance with privacy, copyright, and data protection laws in their scanning practices.

Effective scanning therefore combines automation with critical reflection, ensuring that insight remains reliable, inclusive, and ethically grounded.

## Developing Institutional Intelligence

AI-assisted environmental scanning contributes to a broader capability known as *institutional intelligence*—the collective capacity to sense, interpret, and act upon change. This capability emerges when scanning is embedded in strategic routines rather than treated as an occasional exercise.

Key practices include:

- **Distributed participation:** Encourage multiple teams (e.g., digital education, research strategy, student services) to contribute scanning insights.

- **Shared interpretation:** Use collaborative AI workspaces where staff can annotate or challenge AI-generated briefs.

- **Feedback loops:** Integrate scanning findings into planning cycles, annual reviews, and foresight workshops.

- **Capability building:** Train staff to design effective AI prompts, validate outputs, and apply ethical frameworks.

In this way, generative AI supports a culture of anticipatory learning—where institutions not only respond to external shifts but shape their own futures through proactive intelligence work.

## Ethical, Inclusive, and Responsible Scanning

The ethics of environmental scanning extend beyond data accuracy. AI-driven systems must reflect principles of transparency, fairness, and respect for privacy. Institutions should:

- **Disclose sources and models used** in AI-assisted scanning to maintain trust and accountability.

- **Ensure inclusivity** by including diverse geographical, disciplinary, and cultural perspectives in data inputs.

- **Protect sensitive information** when scanning internal communications or social platforms.

- **Foster critical dialogue** around what counts as a “signal” or “trend,” recognising that AI interpretations are culturally and contextually situated.

Responsible environmental scanning is thus as much a cultural practice as a technical process—requiring ethical literacy and institutional dialogue alongside computational capability.

## Conclusion: From Awareness to Foresight

Generative AI tools enable higher education institutions to move from periodic environmental scans to living systems of strategic awareness. When designed ethically and interpreted critically, these systems provide leaders with early insight into emerging opportunities and risks, supporting agile and evidence-informed decision-making.

By blending human judgement with AI-supported synthesis, universities can transform environmental scanning into a cornerstone of institutional foresight—building not only smarter data systems but also more adaptive, reflective, and resilient organisations.

# Trend Analysis in Higher Education using GenAI

##  **Introduction**

Understanding and anticipating trends in higher education has always been a complex task. Shifting student expectations, global policy shifts, technological disruptions, and changing funding landscapes all interact in unpredictable ways. In this lesson, we explore how generative AI assistants can support educators, analysts, and leaders in identifying, interpreting, and acting upon emerging trends. By integrating AI-supported horizon scanning with human expertise, higher education institutions can move beyond reactive planning toward anticipatory, evidence-informed strategy.

## Understanding Trend Analysis in Higher Education

Trend analysis involves the systematic study of patterns and signals that indicate how the educational landscape is evolving. These trends can include demographic shifts, policy reforms, technological adoption, labour market changes, pedagogical innovations, and broader societal movements such as sustainability or digital equity.

Traditionally, this process required extensive manual review of reports, news, and datasets—activities that demanded significant time and interpretive expertise. Generative AI now introduces a new layer of capability: it can surface, synthesise, and contextualise emerging data in real time.

For example, a university strategy team might prompt an AI assistant to summarise new developments in national quality assurance frameworks or to compare policy trends across OECD countries. The AI can then provide concise summaries, highlight discrepancies, and even suggest potential implications for institutional positioning. The value lies not in the AI’s outputs alone, but in how these are critically reviewed and connected to local context by human decision-makers.

## From Data Overload to Insight Generation

The modern higher education ecosystem generates an overwhelming amount of data—policy updates, accreditation reports, journal articles, student feedback, and international rankings, among others. Generative AI assistants can act as intelligent filters, extracting signal from noise.

A practical workflow might include:

1.  **Automated Data Collection:** Using AI-connected tools to scrape or summarise relevant sources such as policy portals, sector newsletters, and research databases.

2.  **Synthesis and Thematic Mapping:** Asking an AI model to identify recurring themes, emerging challenges, or contradictions between sources.

3.  **Interpretive Dialogue:** Engaging the AI as a thought partner—querying why a particular trend might matter, or what secondary effects could unfold if it accelerates.

4.  **Visualisation and Communication:** Generating summaries, infographics, or scenario cards that make trend insights accessible to wider institutional audiences.

For instance, an AI might highlight a growing pattern of microcredential uptake in postgraduate markets. A leadership team could then use this synthesis to explore whether their institution’s programme portfolio is aligned with emerging learner preferences.

## Human–AI Collaboration in Trend Analysis

AI tools can enhance—but not replace—human judgment. Effective collaboration between analysts and AI assistants requires a clear delineation of roles: the AI can surface possibilities and connections, while humans provide contextual interpretation, ethical awareness, and strategic foresight.

A useful mindset is **“AI as a lens, not a conclusion.”** Generative AI can offer multiple perspectives on a trend—technological, pedagogical, demographic—but human experts decide which angles are most relevant to institutional priorities.

For example, in analysing the trend of AI integration in assessment, the AI may summarise international policy debates, academic papers, and edtech product launches. Human teams must then evaluate these insights through their specific governance frameworks, considering academic integrity, inclusivity, and workload implications.

Collaborative reflection might include:

- Which of these trends are truly global, and which are context-specific?

- How might local culture, policy, or student demographics reshape these patterns?

- What early signals could our institution monitor to stay ahead?

This combination of AI’s breadth and human depth forms the basis of resilient institutional intelligence.

## Applied Example: Mapping Pedagogical Shifts

Imagine a teaching and learning committee exploring the global trend toward “AI-augmented pedagogy.” The team begins by using a generative AI assistant to summarise 50 recent academic articles on AI in higher education. Within minutes, the AI presents clusters of themes: personalised feedback, ethical dilemmas, creative assessment, and student co-agency.

The committee then prompts the AI to create comparative insights:

- How do UK universities differ from Australian or Singaporean counterparts in implementing AI-enhanced assessment?

- Which institutions report positive student outcomes, and what pedagogical models underpin them?

The team uses these AI-synthesised insights as discussion prompts, not definitive evidence. Human participants critique biases, explore contradictions, and identify opportunities for their own institutional pilot projects.

The process transforms literature review into strategic foresight. Rather than reacting to headlines, the institution uses AI-assisted sensemaking to define its own learning innovation trajectory.

## Critical Evaluation and Ethical Considerations

While generative AI accelerates the discovery of trends, it also introduces interpretive risks. Models trained on publicly available data may overrepresent dominant narratives or Western-centric perspectives. They might also conflate correlation with causation, presenting speculative insights as facts.

Responsible trend analysis requires transparent and critical engagement with AI outputs. Institutions should adopt practices such as:

- **Triangulation:** Cross-checking AI-generated claims against independent, peer-reviewed, or verified data sources.

- **Bias Auditing:** Reflecting on which types of trends are amplified or ignored by the AI model.

- **Attribution and Documentation:** Recording prompt histories, versioning AI outputs, and ensuring traceability in reports.

A structured reflective workflow could involve documenting not only *what* the AI surfaced, but *how* it did so—acknowledging any limitations or blind spots. Embedding these ethical safeguards ensures that AI-supported trend analysis strengthens, rather than distorts, institutional decision-making.

## Generative Foresight Models

Generative AI’s capacity to model relationships between variables enables the creation of **“generative foresight models.”** These models can extrapolate from current data to suggest plausible futures, enabling leaders to visualise long-term trajectories.

For example, an institutional research office might ask an AI assistant:

> “Generate three plausible futures for postgraduate education demand in the next five years, given current global migration, digital learning, and policy trends.”

The AI could respond with scenarios such as:

1.  **Global Mobility Rebound:** Increased international enrolments as travel normalises.

2.  **Microcredential Convergence:** Short-form, stackable learning becomes dominant.

3.  **AI-Led Personalisation:** Institutions compete on adaptive learning experience quality.

The team would then analyse each scenario for strategic relevance, assigning early indicators (e.g., visa policy changes, funding models, or employer partnerships) to monitor. Such structured use of AI-generated foresight helps universities prepare adaptive strategies rather than static plans.

## Building Institutional Capacity for Trend Literacy

AI-driven trend analysis should not be confined to senior leadership teams. Building “trend literacy” across faculties and departments ensures a distributed capacity for strategic awareness.

Training sessions might focus on:

- Crafting effective AI prompts for environmental scanning.

- Using AI to generate sector summaries for committee discussions.

- Embedding AI-assisted foresight exercises in curriculum design and quality enhancement.

Over time, this shared capability cultivates a culture of anticipatory learning—where staff at all levels can identify weak signals of change and engage constructively with institutional strategy.

To sustain this momentum, some institutions establish **AI Foresight Labs**—cross-functional working groups that meet quarterly to review AI-generated analyses, interpret their relevance, and document lessons learned. This turns trend analysis from an episodic activity into a continuous, reflective practice.

## Linking Trend Analysis to Strategic Decision-Making

Trend analysis becomes meaningful when its insights influence real decisions. Generative AI can help translate descriptive insights (“what’s happening”) into prescriptive and reflective discussions (“what should we do about it?”).

For example, insights about rising expectations for flexible delivery could inform investment in modular curriculum infrastructure. Trends in AI literacy across the sector could shape professional development priorities.

AI-generated briefing papers or dashboards can support governance boards in aligning long-term strategy with emerging realities. When paired with transparent reflection logs, these tools also foster accountability—making it clear how foresight activities feed into institutional decision-making.

## Conclusion

Generative AI is transforming how higher education institutions analyse and interpret trends. By combining AI’s synthesising power with human contextual intelligence, universities can navigate complexity with greater agility and foresight. The challenge is not simply to use AI to find more information, but to deepen understanding—seeing connections, questioning assumptions, and envisioning possibilities.

In the next lesson, *Building Strategic Scenarios with AI Support*, we extend these practices into structured scenario development, showing how trend analysis becomes a foundation for collaborative, forward-looking strategy in an age of intelligent institutions.

# Building Strategic Scenarios with AI Support

## Introduction

In an era of rapid change and increasing complexity, universities and research institutions must learn to anticipate multiple possible futures rather than rely on linear projections. Scenario planning is a strategic discipline that enables decision-makers to visualise plausible, diverse futures and test how current assumptions might perform within them. Generative AI brings a new level of sophistication to this process, enabling more rapid synthesis of evidence, creation of narrative-rich scenarios, and exploration of the implications of complex drivers. This lesson explores how educators, institutional leaders, and strategic planners can use AI assistants to construct, refine, and stress-test strategic scenarios that inform long-term institutional intelligence.

## Understanding Strategic Scenarios in Higher Education

Strategic scenarios are not predictions — they are structured stories about possible futures. Each scenario captures a different combination of social, technological, economic, environmental, political, and cultural forces (often referred to through the **STEEPC** or **PESTLE** frameworks). In higher education, such scenarios might explore how funding models evolve, how AI reshapes academic labour, how global mobility changes, or how student expectations shift in response to digital learning ecosystems.

Traditionally, building these scenarios required months of expert consultation and synthesis of vast data sources. Generative AI assistants now allow institutional teams to compress this process dramatically by:

- Summarising large-scale policy documents, think-tank reports, and foresight studies.

- Cross-mapping trends to institutional strategies and risk registers.

- Generating divergent narratives that express distinct combinations of drivers and uncertainties.

By integrating these capabilities into scenario planning, universities can democratise foresight — inviting broader participation from faculty, students, and professional staff who can test their assumptions against AI-augmented models of the future.

**Step 1: Framing the Purpose and Scope  **
The first step in AI-supported scenario building is **clarifying purpose**. What decisions will the scenarios inform? Are they intended to explore potential funding shifts, policy changes, demographic trends, or technological disruptions? AI assistants can support this phase by helping teams articulate scope questions through structured prompting. For example:

> “Generate five alternative framing questions for a university’s strategic foresight exercise focusing on the future of international partnerships in 2035.”

Through such exploratory dialogue, AI helps refine the boundaries of inquiry — ensuring that scenarios remain anchored in the institution’s mission, context, and risk appetite. The outcome is a clear set of guiding questions that structure subsequent data gathering and analysis.

**Step 2: Identifying Key Drivers and Uncertainties**  
A robust scenario framework depends on a balanced understanding of **driving forces** and **critical uncertainties**. Generative AI can support this analytical stage in several ways:

1.  **Data synthesis:** AI can scan multiple sources — research reports, policy briefings, news coverage — to identify recurring themes (e.g., AI ethics regulation, transnational education, sustainability mandates).

2.  **Clustering and weighting:** AI can categorise drivers according to their level of impact and uncertainty, suggesting which factors might serve as pivotal axes in a scenario matrix.

3.  **Visualisation and sensemaking:** AI-integrated tools (text-to-chart or text-to-diagram generators) can create conceptual maps showing interdependencies between drivers.

For example, a university might identify two high-impact uncertainties — *AI regulation stringency* and *global student mobility patterns*. These could become the axes of a 2x2 matrix, yielding four divergent futures. AI helps articulate and evidence each of these, drawing from real-world indicators and forecasts.

**Step 3: Crafting Scenario Narratives**  
This is where the creative and interpretive power of generative AI truly shines. Once the structure is defined, AI can co-develop **scenario narratives** that describe the lived experience of future institutional contexts.

For instance, one scenario might describe *The Regulated Renaissance*, where AI is tightly controlled but used ethically to drive quality assurance and inclusive education. Another might outline *The Decentralised University*, where micro-credentials and blockchain-driven governance dominate.

AI assistants can:

- Translate bullet-point data into vivid, narrative-rich descriptions that resonate with stakeholders.

- Embed qualitative detail (e.g., quotes from fictionalised stakeholders, student experiences, media headlines) to make the scenario feel tangible.

- Adjust tone or depth according to audience — from visionary executive briefings to detailed planning documents.

The human role remains essential here: curating, refining, and validating AI-generated scenarios to ensure contextual realism and conceptual balance.

**Step 4: Testing for Internal Coherence and Plausibility**  
Scenario narratives gain credibility when they are internally consistent and grounded in plausible cause-effect relationships. AI assistants can be prompted to perform **consistency checks**, such as:

> “Evaluate whether the following scenario contains any contradictions between technological assumptions and regulatory constraints.”

They can also perform **cross-impact analysis**, identifying potential reinforcing or conflicting dynamics among drivers. For example, an AI might flag that a scenario assuming both *low regulation* and *high public trust* may lack plausibility.

AI can further generate comparative tables summarising risks, opportunities, and key signals to monitor for each scenario. This structured output helps institutions maintain analytical rigour even when working with narrative-rich material.

**Step 5: Linking Scenarios to Decision Pathways**  
The ultimate purpose of scenario planning is to **enhance decision-making under uncertainty**. Once scenarios are articulated, AI tools can help translate insights into strategic options, such as:

- What policies or partnerships would be resilient across all scenarios?

- Which innovations should the institution pilot now to remain adaptive?

- How might risk registers or strategic KPIs evolve under each future?

AI can generate comparative matrices mapping strategies to scenarios, highlighting which actions are robust, contingent, or vulnerable. These outputs can inform board-level discussions, institutional risk committees, or faculty-level strategic planning cycles.

By turning abstract foresight into tangible decision pathways, AI helps close the gap between vision and action.

**Step 6: Enabling Participatory Foresight**  
Generative AI allows foresight to move beyond elite executive circles. Through facilitated workshops, educators and staff can use conversational AI platforms to co-create scenario components, test ideas, and visualise futures in real time.

For example:

- Workshop participants could each prompt an AI assistant to describe the higher education landscape in 2040 from different disciplinary perspectives.

- AI could synthesise these contributions into composite scenarios, highlighting tensions and common themes.

- The resulting materials could be reviewed collaboratively for ethical, pedagogical, and operational implications.

This approach supports a **culture of foresight literacy**, making strategic imagination a distributed capability rather than a specialist function.

## Ethical and Methodological Considerations

While AI accelerates and broadens participation in scenario planning, it also introduces methodological and ethical risks. Generated content may reflect **training-data biases**, **Western-centric perspectives**, or **simplistic cause-effect assumptions**. Institutions must therefore combine AI support with human criticality, asking:

- Who is represented in these futures, and who is absent?

- What epistemic assumptions underpin the AI’s synthesis of trends?

- How can plural worldviews — Indigenous, Global South, or community-based perspectives — be integrated into scenario work?

Embedding these questions into AI-augmented foresight ensures that futures work remains inclusive, reflexive, and ethically grounded.

## From Foresight to Institutional Intelligence

Strategic scenarios are not endpoints but **dynamic artefacts** within a broader intelligence system. Generative AI can help maintain and update these artefacts by scanning new information and highlighting early signals that align with or contradict existing scenarios. In this way, the scenario library becomes a living tool for continuous learning, not a one-off exercise.

When linked to institutional dashboards or n8n-based automation workflows, these scenarios can even trigger alerts — for example, when policy language or media sentiment begins to resemble elements of a particular future state. This closes the loop between foresight and operational intelligence, turning strategic imagination into actionable readiness.

## Conclusion

Building strategic scenarios with AI support transforms foresight from a niche planning activity into a collaborative, ongoing practice of institutional learning. Generative AI enables rapid synthesis, creative narration, and participatory engagement while maintaining the rigour of evidence-based reasoning. When guided by human judgement, ethical reflection, and critical interpretation, these AI-augmented scenarios allow institutions to prepare for multiple plausible futures with clarity and confidence.

By learning to work with AI as a co-analyst, co-narrator, and sensemaking partner, higher education leaders can turn uncertainty into opportunity — ensuring their strategies remain resilient, responsive, and visionary in the face of change.

# Stress-Testing Institutional Plans with Simulations

## Introduction

In an era of accelerating change and complexity, higher education institutions must ensure their strategic plans are not only visionary but also resilient under pressure. Stress-testing institutional plans with AI-powered simulations enables leaders to evaluate how strategies perform under multiple plausible futures—economic downturns, demographic shifts, policy reforms, or technological disruption. This lesson explores how generative AI can help create, analyse, and refine scenario-based simulations that strengthen institutional foresight, reduce strategic blind spots, and promote adaptive decision-making.

## Understanding the Purpose of Stress Testing

Traditional strategic planning assumes a relatively stable environment, where cause-and-effect relationships can be predicted through linear projections. However, in higher education, many factors—student behaviour, global mobility, funding models, and regulatory environments—are increasingly unpredictable. Stress-testing is a process borrowed from finance and systems engineering, where plans are subjected to simulated shocks to identify weaknesses before they manifest in reality.

In a university context, this means asking:

- How robust is our strategy if international enrolments decline sharply?

- What happens to our research priorities if a funding stream disappears?

- How might automation affect staffing models or learning delivery modes?

Generative AI assistants can help model these "what-if" scenarios quickly and creatively, providing decision-makers with nuanced insights into resilience, interdependency, and recovery pathways. The goal is not to predict the future, but to cultivate strategic agility—the ability to pivot when conditions shift.

## How Generative AI Enables Institutional Simulations

Generative AI expands the capability of scenario analysis by synthesising diverse data sources and generating plausible narratives, system diagrams, and simulation models. It can process both qualitative and quantitative variables, making it particularly suited to complex, multidisciplinary settings like universities.

1.  **Data Aggregation and Contextualisation  **
    AI assistants can collect and synthesise signals from open datasets—enrolment patterns, labour market trends, demographic shifts, or policy updates—and contextualise them for institutional relevance. For example, a ChatGPT-like model can summarise OECD or UNESCO reports into localised risk factors affecting a specific university’s strategic plan.

2.  **Model Generation and Scenario Crafting  **
    Generative models can help articulate potential futures in narrative form:

    - *Optimistic scenario*: sustained funding and global research partnerships.

    - *Disruptive scenario*: regional economic contraction or geopolitical restrictions.

    - *Transformative scenario*: radical innovation in AI-based learning delivery.  
      These narratives can be used as inputs for structured discussions, dashboards, or system maps that visualise causal relationships and tipping points.

3.  **Agentic Simulation and Decision Pathways  **
    When paired with simulation tools or agent-based modelling frameworks, AI can approximate how different actors—students, staff, funders, regulators—might respond to strategic shifts. For instance, generative agents can simulate student decision-making under fee changes, or how faculty engagement evolves when hybrid teaching policies expand.

4.  **Stress Response Analysis  **
    AI-driven simulations can measure how quickly an institution can recover from shocks. If a model predicts a high vulnerability to digital infrastructure failure, this insight can inform governance updates, investment in redundancy systems, or staff capability-building.

The advantage of generative AI lies in its ability to turn complexity into comprehensible narratives and testable models, translating foresight into actionable governance insights.

## Applied Scenario: Testing a Digital Transformation Plan

Imagine a university planning a major digital transformation initiative—shifting core teaching and administrative systems to AI-assisted platforms over five years. Using generative AI, the strategic planning team can design multiple stress tests:

- **Scenario 1: Rapid Tech Evolution  **
  AI tools evolve faster than expected, leading to obsolescence of systems mid-implementation. The simulation explores how modular procurement strategies or open-source architectures could mitigate dependency on specific vendors.

- **Scenario 2: Data Ethics Backlash  **
  Student and staff unions express concern over data privacy and algorithmic bias. The AI-generated narrative helps leaders anticipate reputational risks and design proactive transparency measures, such as ethical audits and participatory governance.

- **Scenario 3: Funding Constraints  **
  A simulated fiscal shock—reduced government grants—tests whether phased rollouts and flexible staffing models could sustain progress without compromising service quality.

- **Scenario 4: Cultural Resistance  **
  AI-generated personas model how staff or students might resist changes due to workload concerns or trust issues. This informs a parallel change management plan focusing on dialogue, training, and co-creation.

In each simulation, generative AI helps visualise ripple effects across financial, pedagogical, and operational domains. The resulting “resilience map” becomes an evidence-informed guide for adjusting timelines, priorities, or resource allocations.

## Integrating AI Simulations into Institutional Governance

Stress-testing should not be a one-off exercise but an embedded element of strategic governance. Generative AI can support this institutionalisation in several ways:

1.  **Strategic Foresight Dashboards  **
    AI assistants can generate live dashboards that track scenario indicators—policy changes, enrolment shifts, climate impacts—and prompt leaders to revisit assumptions when thresholds are crossed.

2.  **Participatory Simulation Workshops  **
    Faculty and professional staff can interact with AI-generated scenarios through workshops where generative models facilitate brainstorming or debate. This approach builds shared ownership of risk management.

3.  **Feedback Loops and Learning Systems  **
    Generative AI can summarise post-simulation reflections and convert them into structured learning records for continuous improvement. Over time, the institution develops a "foresight memory" that captures how plans performed under test and what adaptations succeeded.

4.  **Ethical and Governance Oversight  **
    Simulations that model human or social systems require ethical sensitivity. AI should not oversimplify or stereotype behaviour. Institutions must ensure transparency in assumptions and invite stakeholder review of model parameters to maintain trust.

Embedding stress-testing into decision-making thus cultivates a culture of curiosity, humility, and preparedness—core tenets of responsible institutional intelligence.

## Evaluating the Quality and Impact of AI Simulations

To ensure rigour, AI-enabled simulations should be evaluated along clear dimensions:

- **Relevance:** Does the simulation model factors genuinely critical to institutional success?

- **Diversity:** Does it explore multiple, even uncomfortable, futures rather than converging on one?

- **Transparency:** Are the underlying data sources, assumptions, and model logic visible for review?

- **Actionability:** Do simulation insights lead to tangible strategy adjustments or learning outcomes?

- **Ethical Integrity:** Does the process respect confidentiality, fairness, and inclusivity?

Institutions can develop simple rubrics aligned to these criteria, allowing leadership teams to compare simulations across units or timeframes. Generative AI can even automate this meta-assessment, identifying gaps in coverage or overreliance on specific datasets.

## Linking to Broader Strategy and Foresight Practice

Stress-testing is most powerful when integrated into the wider foresight cycle—environmental scanning, trend analysis, scenario development, and strategy alignment. By connecting simulations to earlier phases, institutions can ensure coherence and avoid reactive decision-making.

For instance, insights from **AI-based environmental scanning** (Lesson 1) can feed into simulation inputs, while outcomes from **AI-supported scenario building** (Lesson 3) provide the narrative foundation for testing. The final phase—**linking strategic foresight to operational strategy** (Lesson 5)—then uses these simulation results to adjust policies, budgets, and KPIs.

Generative AI becomes the connective tissue in this ecosystem, maintaining continuity between imagination and execution, between anticipation and adaptation.

## Key Takeaways

AI-assisted stress-testing transforms strategic planning from a static document into a living, adaptive process. It helps universities:

- Expose vulnerabilities and dependencies before they cause crises.

- Explore diverse futures through rich, data-informed simulations.

- Foster collective ownership of resilience planning across departments.

- Integrate ethical, transparent, and participatory foresight into governance.

By combining human insight with generative intelligence, institutions can move beyond risk avoidance toward strategic adaptability—learning from simulated futures to act wisely in the present. Stress-testing, when supported by AI, becomes not merely an exercise in defence but a catalyst for institutional learning, innovation, and renewal.

# Linking Strategic Foresight to Operational Strategy

##  Introduction

Strategic foresight enables institutions to imagine multiple possible futures, anticipate disruption, and prepare adaptive responses. Yet foresight alone is insufficient if it remains detached from day-to-day operations and decision-making. This lesson explores how generative AI (GenAI) can bridge the gap between visionary foresight and practical implementation, helping higher education institutions translate long-range insights into executable, measurable strategies. We examine how AI assistants can surface connections between foresight outputs and institutional planning cycles, align scenarios with policy instruments, and support leaders in building organisational agility through data-informed dialogue.

## Understanding the Connection: From Foresight to Action

In many universities and research organisations, foresight exercises occur within strategic planning workshops or policy retreats, often generating insightful but underutilised outputs. Reports identify “emerging trends,” “potential disruptors,” or “preferred futures,” but operational units struggle to interpret or act on them. This disconnect arises because foresight and operations typically use different languages—one oriented toward exploration and narrative, the other toward metrics and implementation.

Generative AI assistants can act as translators between these two spheres. By prompting AI to map foresight themes (e.g., demographic shifts, AI literacy, funding diversification) against institutional goals and operational indicators, leaders can see how abstract possibilities translate into concrete actions. For instance, an AI assistant could synthesise foresight workshop transcripts into actionable categories—“curriculum innovation,” “infrastructure resilience,” “student inclusion”—and then match these to existing departmental plans, identifying overlaps and gaps.

This capacity to move between the speculative and the pragmatic is where AI-supported foresight becomes institutionally transformative. It allows leadership teams to maintain long-term vision while continuously refining near-term actions through feedback loops.

## Using GenAI to Bridge Vision and Execution

Generative AI can serve as a connective layer between the strategic and operational levels of an institution by performing three key functions:

#### **1. Mapping Strategic Themes to Operational Plans**

An AI assistant can analyse foresight documents, strategic frameworks, and performance reports to extract recurrent themes. These are then cross-referenced with operational plans, revealing where foresight-driven priorities already exist, where they need embedding, and where tensions or contradictions occur.  
For example, if a foresight exercise anticipates “AI-enabled student support systems,” the AI assistant can search institutional strategies for corresponding operational initiatives (such as digital learning or student analytics projects). It can then generate a matrix mapping foresight insights to operational ownership, timelines, and performance metrics.

#### **2. Creating Iterative Foresight-to-Action Pipelines**

AI systems can support ongoing alignment by creating living documents—strategic dashboards that update as foresight scenarios evolve. Using generative prompts, decision-makers can request monthly updates on how emerging policy changes or technological trends might influence institutional risk profiles. These dashboards become an adaptive interface between future thinking and real-time management, ensuring foresight is continuously integrated rather than periodically revisited.

#### **3. Supporting Scenario Translation into KPIs**

One of the hardest challenges in linking foresight to operations is converting narrative scenarios into measurable objectives. Generative AI can assist by identifying plausible key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned with each scenario. For example, in a “digitally hybrid future,” AI might suggest metrics like the proportion of programmes offering AI-assisted learning or the percentage of staff completing digital capability training. These indicators provide operational entry points for foresight-informed change.

## Applied Scenario: Translating Foresight Insights into Institutional Planning

Imagine a university’s strategic foresight team uses GenAI to model scenarios for the “Future of Research Collaboration in 2035.” The outputs include:

- **Scenario A:** Global Data Commons—open research ecosystems and shared data protocols.

- **Scenario B:** Regional Innovation Clusters—localised networks driven by funding and policy.

- **Scenario C:** AI-Led Knowledge Creation—automation of discovery and synthesis processes.

When these are handed to operational leads, they face a translation problem: how do these futures connect to next year’s budget or faculty development plan?

By engaging a GenAI assistant, the planning office can:

1.  **Extract actionable implications** (e.g., “invest in open-data infrastructure,” “retrain researchers for AI-supported analysis”).

2.  **Cluster them by time horizon** (short-term, medium-term, long-term).

3.  **Assign ownership** (research office, IT, HR, library services).

4.  **Generate risk–benefit summaries** for each action.

Through this iterative use of AI, foresight narratives become integrated into institutional operations, making the strategic plan both future-aware and execution-ready.

## Institutional Intelligence: AI as Integrative Partner

Linking foresight to operational strategy depends on institutional intelligence—the capacity to synthesise multiple knowledge streams into cohesive decision-making. GenAI enhances this capacity by:

- **Detecting patterns across data silos**: AI can merge environmental scanning data (e.g., global education trends) with internal performance metrics (e.g., course completion rates), surfacing correlations that point to strategic leverage points.

- **Enhancing cross-unit communication**: Summaries generated by AI assistants can be tailored for different audiences—executive summaries for leadership, data visualisations for analytics teams, or scenario briefings for academic boards.

- **Creating feedback loops**: AI-generated progress reports can track whether foresight-driven priorities are influencing actual projects, establishing a cycle of reflection, adjustment, and renewal.

Through these roles, AI does not replace human judgment but amplifies organisational awareness. It enables universities to move from reactive management to anticipatory governance.

## Challenges and Critical Reflections

While GenAI can enable powerful foresight–strategy integration, several risks and governance questions must be acknowledged:

1.  **Over-Reliance on AI Interpretation  **
    AI models can over-emphasise pattern coherence, smoothing out the diversity of viewpoints that foresight aims to preserve. Human facilitation remains essential to maintain creative pluralism and dissent within strategic conversations.

2.  **Bias and Blind Spots  **
    AI’s pattern recognition depends on training data, which may privilege certain geopolitical or disciplinary perspectives. Institutions should adopt transparent oversight processes, ensuring that foresight analysis includes equity and inclusivity checks.

3.  **Institutional Readiness  **
    Linking foresight to operations requires digital and cultural maturity. Without adequate staff capacity or leadership buy-in, AI-supported foresight may remain peripheral. Leaders must invest in literacy and shared understanding across strategy, analytics, and academic functions.

4.  **Ethical Accountability  **
    Decisions grounded in AI-assisted foresight should include audit trails—who made the judgment, on what basis, and how alternative futures were considered. Governance frameworks should ensure interpretability and responsibility at each step.

By proactively addressing these challenges, institutions can cultivate responsible foresight ecosystems that are both visionary and grounded.

## Framework for Practice: The Foresight–Operations Alignment Loop

A practical approach to operationalising foresight through GenAI can follow a cyclical model:

1.  **Scan and Sense** – Use AI tools for environmental scanning, collecting signals from global policy, research funding, and technological change.

2.  **Synthesize and Scenario** – Generate scenarios collaboratively, using AI to identify patterns and tensions.

3.  **Translate and Align** – Map each scenario’s implications to operational domains and policy instruments.

4.  **Implement and Monitor** – Support decision-makers with AI-generated dashboards linking actions to foresight indicators.

5.  **Reflect and Recalibrate** – Use AI-assisted evaluation to assess outcomes, updating foresight assumptions as the environment evolves.

This cyclical process forms an institutional learning engine—where foresight continuously informs operations, and operational data, in turn, refines foresight.

## From Vision to Value: Re-Embedding Foresight in Strategy

The ultimate goal of linking foresight to operational strategy is not merely alignment but transformation—embedding an anticipatory mindset into the everyday functioning of an institution. Generative AI helps achieve this by:

- **Reducing the latency** between insight and action.

- **Supporting cross-functional sense-making** between strategy, operations, and governance teams.

- **Facilitating evidence-based adaptability**, where strategy evolves dynamically rather than in fixed cycles.

By integrating AI into the foresight–operations nexus, institutions can evolve from periodic planning to continuous strategic learning. The result is an organisation that not only anticipates change but actively shapes it through informed, iterative action.

## Conclusion

Generative AI provides the connective tissue that allows strategic foresight to become operationally actionable. It helps institutions translate visionary thinking into real-world initiatives, maintaining alignment between long-term aspirations and short-term realities. Through structured mapping, iterative dashboards, and ethically grounded reflection, foresight can drive practical outcomes across teaching, research, and governance.

In linking foresight to operational strategy, higher education leaders move from forecasting isolated futures to designing adaptive systems capable of thriving amid uncertainty—a core capability for any institution aspiring to institutional intelligence in the age of AI.

# Key Takeaways

## **From Static Scanning to Living Institutional Intelligence**

> Real-time, AI-assisted environmental scanning transforms one-off reports into a continuous sensing system that tracks policy, technology, demographic, and global signals. Institutions move from simply collecting information to cultivating an ongoing, anticipatory awareness of change.

## **AI as Lens, Not Conclusion in Trend Analysis**

> Generative AI filters noise, clusters themes, and surfaces emerging trends, but its outputs remain starting points for human interpretation rather than definitive answers. Treating AI as a lens rather than a verdict preserves critical, contextual judgement in strategic decision-making.

## **Scenario Planning Becomes Faster, Richer, and More Participatory**

> AI dramatically compresses the time needed to build strategic scenarios by synthesising evidence, generating divergent narratives, and checking internal coherence. This enables wider participation—from faculty, students, and professional staff—turning foresight into a shared institutional practice rather than an elite exercise.

## **Stress-Testing Plans with AI Simulations Exposes Hidden Fragilities**

> AI-supported simulations allow universities to test strategies against shocks such as funding cuts, policy shifts, or technology disruptions before they occur. By exploring how plans behave under pressure, institutions can redesign portfolios, governance structures, and change programmes to be more resilient.

## **Linking Foresight to Operations Through AI “Connective Tissue”**

> GenAI bridges visionary thinking and day-to-day management by mapping scenario implications onto operational plans, budgets, ownership, and KPIs. Foresight outputs become living dashboards and alignment loops, reducing the gap between long-range imagination and near-term action.

## **Ethical and Inclusive Foresight as a Governance Imperative**

> AI-augmented scanning, trend analysis, and simulations can easily reproduce dominant narratives or overlook marginalised perspectives. Building in transparency, bias auditing, participatory review, and clear accountability turns foresight from a technocratic exercise into a reflective, ethically grounded practice.

## **From Radar Screen to Flight Controls: Foresight as Operational Engine**

> The chapter reframes foresight not as a distant radar screen but as part of the institution’s “flight controls”, feeding directly into course corrections, investment decisions, and risk management. In this speculative comparison, AI helps the organisation fly through turbulence—continuously updating its route rather than waiting for the next planning cycle.

# Practical Use Cases

## **Departmental Curriculum Lead Using AI for Live Signals**

As Programme Director for Public Health, I use an AI assistant to run continuous environmental scanning around global health policy, digital epidemiology, and AI in assessment. Each Monday, I receive a brief summarising new WHO guidance, UK policy consultations, and emerging debates on AI-enabled surveillance. I ask the assistant to cluster these into trends affecting our MSc, linking directly to concepts from our environmental scanning and trend analysis lessons.

When a cluster of signals around “AI literacy for health professionals” appears, I prompt the AI to map these against our current modules and highlight gaps. It suggests options: a new elective on AI in population health, refreshed learning outcomes, and updated case studies. I then convene a small design group to review these AI-generated ideas, critique assumptions, and decide which to prototype for the next programme review cycle. Human academic judgement ultimately decides what is pedagogically sound and contextually appropriate.

To keep this work grounded, I also ask the AI to flag weak signals that might affect equity—for example, bias in AI triage tools used in lower-income settings—so we can embed global justice into curriculum redesign.

Follow-up AI prompts

- “Scan UK and global public health bodies for new AI-in-health policies relevant to postgraduate teaching in the next 3–5 years.”

- “Map emerging AI-in-health competencies against our current MSc modules and identify three curriculum gaps.”

- “Generate scenario prompts exploring misuse of AI in public health decision-making for classroom debate.”

- “Suggest inclusive case studies on AI and health from Global South contexts suitable for masters-level seminars.”

- “Draft an agenda for a 90-minute curriculum meeting using AI-generated trend insights as discussion triggers.”

## **Faculty Digital Education Manager Stress-Testing a Digital Strategy**

As Faculty Digital Education Manager, I am responsible for implementing a five-year digital learning strategy. Using lessons on simulations and stress-testing, I work with an AI assistant to model how our plan holds up under different futures. I first feed in core components of the strategy—AI-assisted marking pilots, virtual labs, and student analytics tools—alongside key external drivers from our trend analysis work.

The AI generates three contrasting stress-test scenarios: a data privacy backlash, a sudden funding cut, and a rapid policy shift mandating AI transparency. For each, it simulates likely impacts on staff workload, student trust, and infrastructure, using narrative and simple causal diagrams. I then ask the AI to propose mitigation options: phased roll-outs, explicit consent mechanisms, and diversified technology vendors. My role is to challenge these proposals, test them against local union agreements, and check alignment with institutional values. Human oversight is non-negotiable, especially where staff data, academic workload, and student rights are concerned.

I summarise the results into a “resilience map” for our faculty board, showing which parts of the strategy are robust across scenarios and which are fragile. This turns the AI simulations into concrete decisions: revising the implementation timetable, prioritising staff development, and earmarking contingency funds.

Follow-up AI prompts

- “Simulate the impact of a major data breach on staff and student trust in our faculty’s digital strategy.”

- “Stress-test our virtual lab roll-out under a 20% capital budget cut and propose three adaptation options.”

- “Identify policy and regulatory trends that could constrain AI-assisted marking in UK higher education.”

- “Draft a briefing for union representatives explaining our AI stress-testing approach and safeguards.”

- “Propose staff development activities that would increase resilience across all three simulated futures.”

## **Cross-Institution Planner Using AI to Coordinate Scenarios**

As Head of Strategic Planning across a multi-campus university, I use AI-supported scenario planning to align different local strategies. Each campus has distinct priorities—one research-intensive, one teaching-focused, one community-oriented—yet all are affected by sector-wide trends we explore in our scenario-building lessons.

I ask a generative AI assistant to synthesise campus-level planning documents, environmental scans, and trend analyses into three cross-institution strategic scenarios: “Fragmented Futures”, “Hybrid Excellence”, and “Local Anchor University”. For each, the AI describes plausible changes in student demographics, funding mixes, and AI adoption. I then convene workshops where campus teams critique these AI-generated narratives, adding local nuance and challenging unrealistic assumptions. AI gives us a fast, structured starting point; human stakeholders ensure stories remain grounded and inclusive.

Next, I use the AI to generate comparative matrices showing how each campus’s current plans perform within each scenario. We explore questions such as: which investments remain robust, where cross-campus collaboration would reduce risk, and what shared infrastructure (e.g., AI-augmented student support) is needed. Ethical oversight is built in through a small governance group that reviews AI outputs for bias, sector blind spots, and unintended consequences for disadvantaged students.

Follow-up AI prompts

- “Generate three contrasting institution-wide scenarios for our multi-campus university based on our current environmental scans.”

- “Create a comparison table of risks and opportunities for each campus under the ‘Hybrid Excellence’ scenario.”

- “Suggest workshop activities that help staff interrogate AI-generated scenarios rather than accept them uncritically.”

- “Identify shared AI infrastructure investments that would be beneficial across all campuses and scenarios.”

- “Draft a communication plan explaining scenario-planning outcomes to staff and students in accessible language.”

## **National Policy Officer Using AI for Sector Foresight**

As a Senior Policy Officer in a UK sector body, I am tasked with advising on long-term funding and regulation. I use generative AI to perform national-level trend analysis and foresight, building directly on the methods described in the trend analysis and generative foresight lessons.

I start by asking the AI to synthesise data from government consultations, HESA statistics, and international reports into coherent trend clusters: AI in assessment, modular provision, international student volatility, and widening participation. Next, I prompt the AI to generate national-level scenarios describing how these clusters might evolve over 10–15 years, focusing particularly on funding models and regulatory oversight.

These AI-generated insights form a first draft of sector scenarios, which I then refine with colleagues, institutional representatives, and student unions. We interrogate who benefits, who bears the risk, and what assumptions the AI may have baked in about “typical” universities. Human deliberation and values-based scrutiny are central to deciding which futures are desirable, plausible, or to be avoided.

From this work, I ask the AI to propose policy levers—pilot funds, regulatory sandboxes, or capability schemes—that would help institutions stress-test their strategies and link foresight to operational practice. These ideas are translated into options papers for ministers, with clear explanation of how AI analysis was used and where human judgement overrode automated suggestions.

Follow-up AI prompts

- “Summarise the top ten national trends in UK higher education over the next decade using public data sources.”

- “Generate three plausible national funding futures and their impact on diverse institutional types.”

- “Identify risks of reinforcing inequality in AI-driven sector forecasts and propose mitigation strategies.”

- “Draft consultation questions that invite universities to respond to AI-generated sector scenarios.”

- “Produce a briefing note explaining how AI-assisted foresight informed our recommended policy options.”

## **Interdisciplinary Institute Director Using AI Simulations for Operations**

As Director of an AI–Climate Futures Institute, I sit at the intersection of disciplines and missions. Our work spans research, postgraduate education, and policy engagement. To connect strategic foresight with daily operations, I use generative AI to simulate how different climate and AI policy futures affect our institute’s portfolio.

Drawing on lessons about stress-testing and linking foresight to operational strategy, I first ask the AI to integrate global climate scenarios, AI governance debates, and UK research funding trends into a set of interdisciplinary futures. For each, the AI models how demand might shift for our programmes, what types of partnerships would matter, and where research impact opportunities emerge.

I then use AI to translate these futures into operational questions: which programmes to scale, which new microcredentials to prototype, and how to sequence hiring across disciplines. The assistant recommends KPIs—such as diversity of partner sectors, proportion of projects using responsible AI tools, or resilience of our funding mix. My leadership team reviews these proposals, adjusting metrics to reflect our values on equity, openness, and community impact. AI offers integrative pattern recognition; human governance ensures ethical and strategic coherence.

This loop runs twice a year, with AI updating simulations based on new environmental scanning data. It turns scenario planning into an ongoing, interdisciplinary practice rather than a one-off strategy exercise.

Follow-up AI prompts

- “Combine IPCC climate scenarios and AI governance debates into three futures relevant to an AI–Climate Futures Institute.”

- “Simulate how our taught programmes and research themes perform under each future and highlight gaps.”

- “Propose foresight-informed KPIs that connect our strategic themes to operational delivery and partnerships.”

- “Generate partnership archetypes (industry, NGO, city government) appropriate to each future scenario.”

- “Draft a short foresight-informed annual planning brief for institute staff, linking scenarios to next year’s priorities.”

# Learning Activities

## **Designing a Live Environmental Scanning Briefing (Director of Strategy)**

### **Objective**

To design and trial an AI-enabled environmental scanning and briefing process that supports real-time strategic awareness for senior leadership.

### **Task**

You are the Director of Strategy at a UK university preparing a monthly “Strategic Signals Briefing” for the executive team. Using a generative AI assistant, you will design and test a workflow that transforms dispersed data streams into an integrated, foresight-oriented briefing.

First, identify three scanning domains that matter most to your institution over the next three years. For example: policy and regulation, digital and AI in education, and student demand and demographics. For each domain, assemble a short list of representative sources (such as sector bodies, government portals, think tanks, edtech reports, labour market analyses).

Next, use the AI assistant to generate a structured summary for each domain, including: top three developments in the last month, weak signals worth watching, and potential implications for teaching, research, or operations. Then prompt the AI to synthesise across domains, asking it to identify cross-cutting themes, contradictions, and possible “noisy but irrelevant” signals.

Finally, work with the AI to produce a concise, two-page Strategic Signals Briefing designed for non-specialist senior leaders. Include a one-paragraph narrative overview, three strategic questions for discussion, and a short list of suggested next steps or areas for deeper investigation.

### **Example Prompt**

“You are acting as a strategic foresight analyst for a UK university. Using UK and international higher education sources, generate a draft ‘Strategic Signals Briefing’ for the last 30 days. Focus on three domains: policy and regulation, digital and AI in education, and student demand/demographics. For each domain, summarise three key developments, two weak signals, and likely implications for teaching, research, and institutional risk. Then write a one-page synthesis highlighting cross-cutting themes and three strategic questions for our executive team to discuss.”

### **Rationale**

This activity operationalises Lesson 1 by turning environmental scanning into a live, repeatable leadership artefact. Learners experience the shift from raw information to strategic insight, learning to frame scanning as an ongoing, dialogic process rather than a static report. By asking AI to separate strong from weak signals and then challenge its own synthesis, participants practise critical engagement with AI outputs, acknowledging both their value and their limitations. The exercise also surfaces governance and ethical questions, such as data sources, geographical bias, and transparency. Ultimately, the activity builds institutional intelligence by embedding scanning into leadership routines rather than treating it as a separate research function.

### **Transfer & Adaptation Tasks**

### **Task 1 – Different HE Context**

Adapt the briefing for a small, specialist higher education provider (for example, an arts college or a conservatoire). Redesign the scanning domains, sources, and implications to reflect their niche positioning, scale, and resource constraints, then compare the resulting briefings.

### **Task 2 – Cross-Domain Adaptation**

Translate the same workflow for a research council or health-service education partner. Use AI to explore how environmental scanning might work in that context, and co-create a joint briefing that highlights interdependencies between the university and its wider ecosystem.

### **Faculty Trend Clinic: Reimagining a Programme Portfolio (Faculty Education Lead)**

### **Objective**

To use AI-assisted trend analysis to review and reshape a faculty-level programme portfolio in light of emerging sector trends.

### **Task**

You are a Faculty Education Lead tasked with reviewing your faculty’s taught programme portfolio over the next five years. Begin by selecting one discipline area (for example, public health, computing, or business). Using a generative AI assistant, conduct a targeted trend analysis focused on three dimensions: learner expectations, labour market shifts, and pedagogical innovation.

Ask the AI to generate a concise “trend landscape” for your discipline, drawing on international sources and highlighting where UK developments align or diverge. Then request a second pass that focuses specifically on tensions and uncertainties—areas where the data is mixed, contested, or incomplete.

Next, create a “Faculty Trend Clinic” document. With AI support, map the identified trends against your current programme portfolio: where are you clearly aligned, where are you lagging, and where might you be over-invested in declining areas? Ask the AI to suggest three plausible programme-level responses, such as new microcredentials, redesigned core modules, or alternative delivery modes.

Finally, select one existing programme and use the AI to co-design a short internal briefing for its course team. The briefing should summarise relevant trends, suggest three concrete design questions for the next curriculum review, and outline options for low-risk experimentation.

### **Example Prompt**

“You are supporting a Faculty Education Lead in a UK university. Using international data on higher education and labour markets, generate a 1,500-word ‘Trend Landscape’ for postgraduate public health programmes over the next five years. Focus on learner expectations, labour market needs, and pedagogical innovation. Identify at least five key trends, three tensions or uncertainties, and suggest how these might affect our existing portfolio of programmes in a research-intensive UK institution.”

### **Rationale**

This activity operationalises Lesson 2 by connecting abstract trend analysis directly to programme-level decisions. Participants practise moving from broad, AI-generated landscapes to targeted implications for a specific faculty, reinforcing the distinction between description (“what’s happening”) and strategic response (“what might we do?”). By staging a second pass focused on tensions, they learn to resist overly neat narratives and treat AI outputs as prompts for debate rather than final conclusions. The Trend Clinic format also models a practical artefact that can be shared with programme teams, supporting distributed “trend literacy” across the institution.

### **Transfer & Adaptation Tasks**

Task 1 – Different HE Context  
Repeat the activity for a post-92 university with a strong widening participation mission. Ask the AI to emphasise local and regional trends, then compare how the resulting portfolio implications differ from those of a research-intensive institution.

### **Task 2 – Cross-Domain Adaptation**

Adapt the Trend Clinic to an interdisciplinary area such as climate and health, data science and ethics, or creative computing. Use AI to explore how cross-sector trends intersect, and design a briefing that encourages collaboration across departments rather than isolated programme tweaks.

### **Branching Scenario Workshop: Co-Creating Futures with AI (Academic Board Member)**

### **Objective**

To facilitate a participatory scenario planning workshop using generative AI to co-create and explore branching futures for the institution.

### **Task**

You are an Academic Board member leading a half-day workshop on “Our University in 2040.” Design a branching scenario exercise in which participants interact with a generative AI assistant to co-create and navigate multiple futures.

Begin by working with the AI to generate three high-level scenario seeds based on STEEPC/PESTLE drivers: for example, “Regulated AI Renaissance,” “Fragmented Microcampus World,” and “Community-Embedded University.” For each scenario seed, ask the AI to produce a short narrative vignette that includes voices from students, staff, and external partners.

In the workshop, divide participants into three mixed-role groups. Each group picks one scenario seed and, using a shared AI workspace, iteratively questions and refines it. Participants take turns entering prompts in a dialogue format (for example, “Dean of Education,” “Student Representative,” “Professional Services Manager”) and asking the AI to extend, challenge, or complicate the narrative. Every three or four turns, the group introduces a branching choice: a strategic decision the university could make (such as investing in AI-enabled student support or prioritising regional partnerships over global recruitment). The AI then generates divergent branches of the scenario based on these decisions.

After 45–60 minutes, each group extracts three key strategic tensions from their branching scenario. They then use the AI to help translate these tensions into strategic questions for Academic Board and senior leadership, ready for further debate.

### **Example Prompt**

“You are facilitating a participatory scenario planning workshop for a UK university’s Academic Board. Generate three distinct 2040 scenario seeds, each 400–500 words, using STEEPC drivers. For each, include short fictional quotes from a student, an academic, and a professional services colleague. The scenarios should be divergent, plausible, and relevant to UK higher education. End each scenario with two branching decision points the institution could choose between.”

### **Rationale**

This activity brings Lesson 3 to life by emphasising AI as a co-narrator and critical friend, not merely an analyst. The branching structure forces participants to see scenarios as dynamic and contingent on institutional choices, while the dialogue format foregrounds multiple stakeholder perspectives. By scripting prompts from different roles, participants experience how AI can support plural, sometimes conflicting viewpoints rather than collapsing them into a single narrative. The translation step—from branching futures to strategic questions—helps prevent scenario work from remaining abstract, anchoring it in governance and decision-making. The exercise also surfaces ethical considerations around whose futures are foregrounded, and how AI may amplify or mute particular voices.

### **Transfer & Adaptation Tasks** **Task 1 – Different HE Context**

Repeat the branching scenario workshop for a small, specialist institution (such as an art school or teacher training college). Ask the AI to foreground professional identity, local community roles, and sector consolidation pressures, then compare the resulting tensions.

### **Task 2 – Cross-Domain Adaptation**

Adapt the exercise for a joint workshop involving a university and a partner NHS trust, research institute, or FE college. Use AI to generate shared futures that highlight interdependencies, and co-create strategic questions that require joint action rather than isolated institutional responses.

### Simulation Lab: Stress-Testing a Digital Transformation Plan (Institutional Research and Planning Analyst) 

### **Objective:**

To design and run an AI-supported stress test of a major institutional plan, identifying vulnerabilities and adaptive options under multiple simulated shocks.

### **Task:**

You are an Institutional Research and Planning Analyst asked to stress-test your university’s five-year digital transformation strategy. Start by summarising, with AI support, the core assumptions of the strategy across four dimensions: technology, finance, staff capability, and student experience. Use the AI to help you express these assumptions in clear, testable statements (for example, “International enrolments will remain stable,” “Staff will adopt new AI tools within two years”).

Next, work with the AI to design three stress scenarios: a funding shock, a data ethics controversy, and an infrastructural disruption (such as a major system outage or cyber incident). For each scenario, ask the AI to outline a narrative describing how the shock emerges, how it interacts with your strategy’s assumptions, and how different stakeholder groups respond over a three-year period.

Using these narratives, construct a simple simulation lab. For each stress scenario, ask the AI to map the likely impacts on key institutional functions (such as teaching quality, student satisfaction, research performance, staff workload, and regulatory compliance). Then prompt it to identify three potential mitigation or adaptation strategies, and to estimate qualitatively which strategies are “robust across all scenarios,” “helpful but context-specific,” or “high risk/high reward.”

Finally, produce an internal briefing for the executive team that summarises the simulations, highlights the most exposed assumptions, and proposes a small number of priority resilience measures, such as alternative procurement models, staff development investments, or new governance mechanisms.

### **Example Prompt**

“You are supporting an Institutional Research and Planning Analyst at a UK university to stress-test a five-year digital transformation plan. Based on common sector assumptions, generate three plausible stress scenarios: a funding shock, a data ethics controversy, and a major system disruption. For each, describe likely impacts on teaching, student experience, research, staff workload, and regulatory compliance, and suggest three adaptation strategies. Indicate which strategies appear robust across all three scenarios.”

### **Rationale**

This activity translates Lesson 4 into a concrete governance tool, showing how generative AI can transform static plans into dynamic objects of inquiry. Participants practise making assumptions explicit, a critical step often skipped in strategic documents. By asking AI to generate stress scenarios and explore impacts, they learn to view plans as hypotheses rather than certainties. The focus on cross-scenario robustness supports more thoughtful risk management, while the requirement to produce an executive briefing reinforces communication and synthesis skills. The activity also raises ethical questions about how simulations portray staff and students, and how AI might inadvertently normalise certain responses while sidelining others.

### **Transfer & Adaptation Tasks** **Task 1 – Different HE Context**

Apply the same method to stress-test a smaller-scale plan, such as a new online MSc or a collaborative doctoral training centre. Compare how stress scenarios play out when the stakes and time horizons are different, and adjust the resilience strategies accordingly.

### **Task 2 – Cross-Domain Adaptation**

Adapt the Simulation Lab for a non-academic partner, such as a local authority or health provider working with the university. Use AI to co-create joint stress scenarios that affect both organisations, then identify where shared resilience measures could be more effective than isolated responses.

## **Foresight-to-Action Studio: Aligning Scenarios with Operational KPIs (Head of Department or Operations Manager)**

### **Objective**:

To link strategic foresight outputs to operational planning, creating AI-assisted pathways from long-range scenarios to departmental KPIs and improvement projects.

### **Task:**

You are a Head of Department (or Operations Manager) in a UK university that has recently completed an institutional foresight exercise using AI-supported scenarios. Your brief is to translate these scenarios into concrete departmental actions and measures over the next three years.

Begin by selecting two contrasting institutional scenarios from the foresight work (for example, “Digitally Hybrid University” and “Regionally Embedded Civic Anchor”). Using a generative AI assistant, ask for a concise summary of each scenario, focusing on implications for your department’s teaching, research, student support, and partnerships.

Next, create a “Foresight-to-Action Canvas” for your department. With AI support, identify three strategic themes that appear across both scenarios (for example, AI literacy, flexible curriculum structures, or community engagement). For each theme, ask the AI to suggest possible departmental-level initiatives that would be valuable under both futures, and to propose candidate KPIs or indicators that might track progress.

Then, choose one theme and develop it into a mini action plan. Use the AI to help you specify objectives, potential activities, required resources, and risks. Ask it to draft a short narrative explaining how this plan responds to both scenarios, making it suitable for inclusion in faculty or institutional planning documents.

Finally, run a critical check by prompting the AI to identify possible blind spots, equity concerns, or unintended consequences of your chosen initiatives. Adjust your action plan and KPIs in light of these reflections, and document what trade-offs you are making.

### **Example Prompt**

“You are advising a Head of Department at a UK university. The institution has two foresight scenarios: ‘Digitally Hybrid University’ and ‘Regionally Embedded Civic Anchor.’ Summarise each scenario in 300 words, focusing on implications for departmental teaching, research, student support, and partnerships. Then propose three strategic themes that are important in both futures, and suggest one departmental initiative and two potential KPIs for each theme.”

### **Rationale**

This activity enacts Lesson 5 by treating AI as a translator between visionary foresight and everyday operations. Participants practise mapping high-level scenarios onto their own sphere of control, avoiding the common trap where foresight remains abstract and disconnected from planning cycles. The Foresight-to-Action Canvas encourages balanced attention to teaching, research, and civic roles, while the KPI design step forces operational specificity without collapsing uncertainty into rigid targets. The final critical check highlights the importance of ethical reflexivity, asking how AI-supported planning might reproduce or challenge existing inequities. Overall, the activity builds confidence in using AI to support institutional intelligence that is both future-facing and grounded.

### **Transfer & Adaptation Tasks**

Task 1 – Different HE Context  
Repeat the exercise from the perspective of a central professional services unit, such as student services, estates, or IT. Use AI to reinterpret the same institutional scenarios through their lens and design unit-specific initiatives and indicators.

### **Task 2 – Cross-Domain Adaptation**

Adapt the Foresight-to-Action Studio for an interdisciplinary centre (for example, a sustainability institute or digital futures hub) that spans multiple faculties. Use AI to help align foresight themes with cross-faculty collaboration projects and shared KPIs that encourage collective, rather than siloed, action.

# Prompt Templates

## **Scenario Planning Environmental Scan Brief**

### **Troubleshooting Prompts**

If your scan prompts are vague, over-simplified, or not aligned with higher education, try these alternatives:

- “Act as a strategy officer for a UK university. Using the latest global higher education news, policy updates, and edtech reports, produce a one-page environmental scanning brief with sections on policy, technology, funding, and student expectations. Label strong vs weak signals.”

- “You are supporting a university foresight workshop. Summarise this week’s major developments affecting higher education in policy, technology, and labour markets. For each, explain why it matters and suggest one reflective question for senior leadership.”

- “For a research-intensive university focused on global health, generate an environmental scan across three domains: research funding, international collaboration, and AI in teaching. Distinguish confirmed trends from emerging uncertainties and flag any significant risks.”

- “Prepare a briefing note for an academic board meeting. Synthesize recent HE policy consultations, AI-in-education debates, and microcredential developments into 3–5 key themes. For each theme, list likely implications for curriculum, assessment, and staff capability.”

- “Create a concise ‘signal log’ for a university’s digital education team. Extract 5–7 signals from current news and sector reports that relate to AI-enabled learning, student data governance, and online assessment. Classify each as strong or weak and suggest next monitoring steps.”

- “Working from current sector news and foresight reports, generate an environmental scan for a small specialist institution (e.g., public health). Highlight niche risks and opportunities that might be missed in generic HE analyses, and propose questions for a follow-up scenario exercise.”

### **Prompt Revision Lab**

**Initial version:**  
“Give me an environmental scan of higher education.”

**Revised version:**  
“Act as a strategic analyst for a mid-sized UK university. Using up-to-date global higher education news and policy sources, produce a two-page environmental scan with sections on: policy/regulation, funding, technology (especially AI), student demand, and labour market trends. For each section, identify 2–3 key signals and briefly explain their possible impact on our teaching, research, and partnerships.”

**Explanation of improvement:**  
The revised prompt clarifies the role, institutional type, scope of the scan, structure of the output, and explicit linkage to teaching, research, and partnerships. This narrows the AI’s focus, reduces generic commentary, and aligns the scan with the institutional intelligence goals described in the chapter.

**Second refinement**  
“Act as a strategic analyst for a mid-sized UK university specialising in public and global health. Using up-to-date global higher education and health policy news, produce a two-page environmental scan with sections on: (1) policy/regulation (including AI and data governance), (2) funding for health-related research and programmes, (3) technology and AI in teaching and assessment, (4) student demand and mobility patterns. For each section, identify 2–3 strong signals and 1–2 weak signals, briefly explain their possible impact on our teaching, research, and partnerships, and suggest one reflective question for senior leadership.”

Short example outputs (indicative, truncated)

- “Policy/regulation – Strong signal: expansion of national AI assessment regulations may require redesign of coursework in years 1–2…”

- “Technology and AI – Weak signal: early pilots of multimodal AI analytics in comparable institutions could reshape how we monitor student engagement…”

**Reflection question**  
“How did specifying institutional type, domain focus, signal categories (strong/weak), and explicit links to teaching, research, and partnerships change the relevance and depth of the scan compared with your initial, generic prompt?”

## **Trend Synthesis and Thematic Mapping for Foresight**

### **Troubleshooting Prompts**

If your “trend analysis” prompts produce shallow lists or ignore higher education context, use these alternatives:

- “Using recent reports and commentary on higher education, identify 5–7 emerging trends that could shape curriculum design and delivery in the next five years. For each trend, summarise the pattern, give an example, and explain why it matters for programme-level planning.”

- “Act as a trend analyst supporting a university teaching and learning committee. From current HE and labour market evidence, generate a thematic map of trends across: student expectations, AI in assessment, flexible learning, and global mobility. Describe how these trends interact and where there are contradictions.”

- “You are preparing a briefing for a quality assurance review. Synthesise recent trends in AI-augmented pedagogy and microcredentials, focusing on their implications for accreditation, assessment integrity, and inclusive practice. Provide 3–5 questions the review panel should ask.”

- “Produce a concise ‘trend packet’ for faculty deans. Cluster key higher education trends into three themes: participation and access, digital and AI innovation, and funding/governance. For each cluster, explain likely risks, opportunities, and blind spots if the trend is ignored.”

- “From current global HE data, construct three contrasting narrative trends (e.g., ‘Platform University’, ‘Regulated AI Ecosystem’, ‘Reskilling at Scale’). For each, describe how teaching, research, and student services might change, and suggest early indicators to monitor.”

### **Prompt Revision Lab**

**Initial version**: “List current trends in higher education.”

**Revised version**  
“Act as a higher education trend analyst preparing a briefing for a university executive team. Identify 6–8 current trends affecting higher education across student demand, AI and digital learning, funding, and regulation. For each trend, provide: a short description, one concrete example from a real or plausible institution, and a brief comment on how it might affect curriculum, assessment, or academic workload.”

**Explanation of improvement**  
The revised version moves from an unstructured list to a focused, multi-dimensional brief. It specifies audience, number of trends, domains, and required components (description, example, implications), directly reflecting the chapter’s emphasis on moving from data overload to actionable insights.

**Second refinement**  
“Act as a higher education trend analyst preparing a briefing for a university executive team. Identify 6–8 current trends affecting higher education across student demand, AI and digital learning, funding, and regulation. For each trend, provide: (a) a short description, (b) one concrete example from a real or plausible institution, (c) likely implications for curriculum, assessment, or academic workload, and (d) 1–2 reflective questions the executive team should discuss. Conclude with a short paragraph highlighting how these trends might interact in the next five years.”

Short example outputs (indicative, truncated)

- “Trend: Microcredential Expansion – Example: A national university consortium launching stackable short courses in data science for health professionals… Implications: pressure to redesign full programmes, potential workload spikes in curriculum review…”

- “Trend: AI in Assessment – Reflective questions: How do we assure integrity while leveraging AI for feedback? Where are students’ equity risks most acute?”

**Reflection question**

“When you added explicit domains, institutional implications, and reflective questions, how did the AI’s output change in terms of strategic usefulness and alignment with the chapter’s focus on institutional intelligence?”

## **Scenario Matrix and Narrative Pack (with Table Output)** 

### **Troubleshooting Prompts**

If prompts for scenarios are vague or produce generic stories, especially when you need structured formats such as tables and matrices, try these:

- “Act as a foresight facilitator for a research-intensive university. Using PESTLE/ STEEPC thinking, propose a 2x2 scenario matrix based on two critical uncertainties affecting our institution over the next 10–15 years. Present the four scenarios in a table with columns for scenario name, brief description, key drivers, and early indicators.”

- “Using current trends in AI regulation and global student mobility, construct four divergent 2035 higher education scenarios for a UK university. First, present them in a comparison table (scenario name, regulatory context, student mobility, digital learning model, key risks), then provide short narrative summaries.”

- “As an AI-supported foresight assistant, develop three narrative-rich scenarios describing the future of AI in assessment (optimistic, disruptive, constrained). For each scenario, include quotes from fictional stakeholders (students, staff, regulators) to make implications vivid.”

- “Generate a scenario workshop pack for faculty leadership. Include: (a) a simple 2x2 matrix description, (b) a comparison table of the four futures (curriculum, staffing, partnerships, technology), and (c) 3–4 discussion questions to test current assumptions.”

- “Create a set of scenarios for the future of international partnerships in 2040, focusing on public health and global research. Present the scenarios in both tabular form (key axes, risks, opportunities, equity implications) and short stories that could be read aloud in a workshop.”

### **Prompt Revision Lab**

**Initial version**  
“Write some scenarios about the future of universities.”

**Revised version**  
“Act as a strategic foresight facilitator working with a mid-sized UK university. Using current trends in AI, funding, and global mobility, construct a 2x2 scenario framework based on two critical uncertainties. Present your work in two parts: (1) a table with four scenarios (name, brief description, main drivers, key risks, early indicators); (2) a short narrative (150–200 words) for each scenario describing what daily life feels like for staff and students.”

**Explanation of improvement**  
The revised prompt clarifies the institutional context, the drivers, the structure (2x2 framework), and the required formats (table plus narratives). It also foregrounds lived experience, aligning with the chapter’s emphasis on narrative-rich but analytically grounded scenarios.

**Second refinement**  
“Act as a strategic foresight facilitator working with a mid-sized UK university specialising in global health. Using current trends in AI, research funding, and international mobility, construct a 2x2 scenario framework based on two critical uncertainties you identify. Present your work in three parts: (1) a clear explanation of the two uncertainties and why they matter; (2) a comparison table with four scenarios (name, brief description, main drivers, key risks, early indicators, equity implications); (3) a short narrative (150–200 words) for each scenario focusing on teaching, research, and student experience in 2035.”

Short example outputs (indicative, truncated)

- “Uncertainty 1: Stringency of global AI regulation in education. Uncertainty 2: Openness of international mobility and research collaboration…”

- Table row: “Scenario: Regulated Renaissance – Drivers: strict but supportive AI regulation, strong public funding… Equity implications: targeted support for under-represented learners through transparent AI tools…”

**Reflection question**

“How did specifying the table structure, column headings, and narrative focus (teaching, research, student experience, equity) change the usefulness and clarity of the AI-generated scenarios for your own planning or workshop design?”

## **Foresight-to-Operations Alignment Mapper** 

### **Troubleshooting Prompts**

If prompts that aim to connect foresight outputs to operational strategy feel too abstract or disconnected from real planning, use these alternatives:

- “Act as an AI assistant to a university planning office. Given a set of foresight outputs (environmental scans, trend analyses, and scenarios), map 5–7 concrete operational actions for the next three years. For each action, specify the responsible unit, indicative timeline, and a possible KPI.”

- “You are helping translate a ‘Future of Research Collaboration 2035’ scenario into next year’s institutional plan. Generate a table that links scenario implications to operational domains (infrastructure, HR, partnerships, governance) and propose 1–2 actions per domain.”

- “Using the idea of a foresight–operations alignment loop, outline a practical process for a university to revisit its strategic plan annually. Show how environmental scanning, trend analysis, scenario updates, and stress-testing feed into the revision of KPIs and budget priorities.”

- “Create a set of questions a faculty dean could ask when reviewing operational plans against recent foresight findings (e.g., AI in assessment, demographic shifts). Group questions under curriculum, staffing, infrastructure, and partnerships.”

- “Act as a facilitator preparing a cross-unit workshop on linking foresight to operations. Generate a structured agenda where participants use AI-generated scans and scenarios to propose concrete changes to policies, resource allocation, or programme portfolios.”

### **Prompt Revision Lab**

**Initial version**  
“Explain how foresight can be linked to operations.”

Revised version “Act as a planning advisor for a UK university that has just completed a foresight exercise on AI and higher education. Using the themes from environmental scanning, trend analysis, and scenario work, propose 6–8 concrete operational actions for the next three years. For each action, specify: the foresight insight it’s based on, the operational domain (e.g., curriculum, staffing, infrastructure, partnerships), the primary responsible unit, and one draft KPI. Present the result as a structured narrative rather than a table.”

**Explanation of improvement**  
The revised version requests specific, actionable outputs (actions, domains, responsibilities, KPIs) explicitly linked back to different foresight inputs. It also constrains the format, helping ensure the AI produces an alignment map rather than an abstract essay. This mirrors the chapter’s focus on translating foresight into operational reality and institutional intelligence.

**Second refinement**  
“Act as a planning advisor for a UK university that has just completed a foresight exercise on AI and higher education. Using the themes from environmental scanning, trend analysis, scenario building, and stress-testing simulations, propose 6–8 concrete operational actions for the next three years. For each action, specify: (a) the foresight insight or scenario it stems from, (b) the operational domain (curriculum, assessment, staffing, infrastructure, partnerships, governance), (c) the primary responsible unit, (d) one draft KPI and indicative baseline/target, and (e) a short note on potential risks or equity implications. Present the output as a clearly structured narrative with subheadings for each action.”

Short example outputs (indicative, truncated)

- “Action 1 – AI-Ready Curriculum Review: Foresight source: scenario ‘AI-Led Personalisation’; Domain: curriculum; Responsible: Education Committee; KPI: % of programmes with AI literacy outcomes (baseline 10%, target 50% in three years)… Equity note: ensure AI literacy activities are inclusive and accessible.”

- “Action 4 – Resilient Digital Infrastructure: Foresight source: stress-test on digital disruption; Domain: infrastructure; KPI: average recovery time from critical digital incident…”

**Reflection question**  
“When you required explicit links between foresight insights, operational domains, responsibilities, KPIs, and equity considerations, how did that change the AI’s ability to produce outputs you could realistically use in planning and governance processes?”

# Innovative Use Cases

## **Multi-Agent Foresight in Tension** 

> A UK university wants to move beyond occasional horizon-scanning reports and create a living foresight ecosystem. Leadership is excited about AI, but staff worry about opaque models and marginalised perspectives. The institution experiments with a “Foresight Mesh”: a network of specialised AI agents and human teams that continuously scan, model, and stress-test futures across education, health, climate, and labour markets. The central tension is whether this mesh deepens institutional intelligence or simply automates old habits of centralised, top-down planning.

## **Objective – Novel AI Application: The “Foresight Mesh”** 

> The objective is to design and implement a **Foresight Mesh**: a multi-agent AI system that weaves together environmental scanning, trend analysis, scenario building, stress-testing, and operational alignment into a single, recursive workflow.  
> Instead of a lone “strategy dashboard”, the Mesh is composed of distinct but connected AI agents, each with a clear role:

- A **Scanner Agent** that continuously ingests sector signals (policy, technology, demographics, funding) across higher education and adjacent sectors such as public health and climate governance.

- A **Trend Weaver Agent** that clusters signals into cross-sector patterns and identifies weak and strong signals relevant to institutional priorities.

- A **Scenario Maker Agent** that turns patterns into divergent, narrative-rich futures that incorporate student, staff, and community perspectives.

- A **Stress Tester Agent** that simulates how existing institutional plans perform across these scenarios, highlighting vulnerabilities, opportunities, and equity implications.

- A **Bridge Agent** that translates scenario and simulation insights into operational prompts, suggested KPIs, and briefing notes tailored to different audiences (governance, faculty leadership, professional services).  
  Humans act as critical partners: defining institutional values, challenging AI narratives, and deciding which recommendations become real strategies.

## **Task – Step-by-Step Workflow in a Realistic Higher-Education Context**

**Step 1 – Establish the Foresight Mesh Governance Group**  
The university sets up a cross-functional group (strategy office, digital education, estates, student services, research office, and one student representative per faculty). This group defines the values, boundaries, and ethical rules for the Mesh: what data can be used, what sectors are in scope, how equity and decolonial perspectives will be protected, and how AI outputs will be documented and challenged.

**Step 2 – Configure the Scanner Agent**  
Using automation tools (such as n8n) and GenAI, the Scanner Agent is configured to monitor curated sources: HE policy portals, global health alerts, climate risk indices, labour market analytics, digital rights organisations, and AI governance updates. The group defines scanning domains such as “student wellbeing”, “assessment and integrity”, “research funding ecosystems”, and “digital infrastructure resilience”. The Scanner Agent produces weekly raw signal dumps tagged to these domains.

**Step 3 – Activate the Trend Weaver Agent**  
The Trend Weaver Agent is prompted to cluster signals into cross-cutting patterns, for example: “convergence of AI literacy requirements in accreditation frameworks” or “rising mental health concerns linked to economic precarity”. It labels each pattern as a strong or weak signal, explicitly noting data gaps or over-represented regions. The Foresight Mesh Governance Group reviews these clusters monthly, rejecting any that seem spurious or biased and asking the agent to re-run analysis with adjusted parameters.

**Step 4 – Generate Multi-Voice Scenario Sets**  
The Scenario Maker Agent is tasked with creating three to five futures that cut across education, public health, climate policy, and digital rights. Each scenario must:

- Include fictionalised vignettes from different stakeholder perspectives (e.g. a part-time carer-student, a global South partner institution, a professional services manager).

- Surface explicit tensions (e.g. automation vs academic labour, surveillance analytics vs care-based support).

- Provide explicit “equity lenses” (who benefits, who is harmed, whose voices are missing).  
  The Governance Group selects two scenarios per year to become “anchor” futures for institutional conversations.

**Step 5 – Run Stress Tests with the Stress Tester Agent**  
The Stress Tester Agent ingests the university’s current strategic plan, risk register, curriculum transformation projects, and estates plans. For each anchor scenario, it simulates how key assumptions hold up: international recruitment targets, reliance on particular funding streams, modes of delivery, digital infrastructure resilience. Its outputs include narrative simulations (“a five-year storyline” of how a plan unfolds under the scenario) and tabular summaries of risk, opportunity, and equity impacts.

**Step 6 – Translate Foresight into Operational Briefs with the Bridge Agent**  
The Bridge Agent converts scenario and simulation findings into tailored outputs:

- Short, plain-language briefs for academic boards.

- Action matrices for professional services directors (what to maintain, what to reframe, what to prototype).

- Foresight-informed teaching prompts for programme leads (“how might your curriculum need to change under Scenario B?”).

- A small set of foresight-aligned KPIs for senior leaders (e.g. proportion of programmes capable of flexible mode shifts, or staff AI capability metrics).

**Step 7 – Embed Feedback and Recursive Learning**  
After each planning cycle, units report how they engaged with the Mesh outputs. The Governance Group prompts the Mesh to reflect on its own performance: where did simulations misjudge a risk, which data sources were unhelpful, whose voices remained marginal? These reflections feed back into revised prompts, dataset choices, and governance guidelines, creating a recursive loop of improvement.

## **Example Prompt – Usable in Practice**

**Role**: University Foresight Lead working with a GenAI assistant configured as the Trend Weaver Agent.

“Act as a Trend Weaver within our institutional Foresight Mesh for a UK research-intensive university.  
You are given three types of inputs:

1.  Higher education policy changes (UK and OECD),

2.  Signals from adjacent sectors (public health, climate policy, labour markets, digital rights), and

3.  Internal indicators (student wellbeing data, mode-of-study patterns, staff workload surveys).

**Tasks**:

- Cluster these signals into 5–7 cross-sector patterns that matter specifically for our institution’s teaching, research, and student experience.

- For each pattern, label it as a strong or weak signal and explain why.

- For every pattern, state explicitly:  
  a) Which groups may benefit,  
  b) Which groups may be disadvantaged or invisible,  
  c) One question that our academic board should debate.

Return your output in a table with columns: Pattern Name, Signal Strength, Description, Equity/Power Notes, Question for Governance.”

## **Rationale – Why This Innovation Matters Now**

Pedagogically, the Foresight Mesh enables a richer form of anticipatory learning. Staff and students do not receive abstract “trend lists” but encounter concrete futures that show how environmental, health, labour, and technological shifts intersect with curriculum, assessment, student support, and research. This supports deeper conversation about what it means to design resilient, justice-aware programmes in an age of compounding crises.  
Institutionally, the Mesh addresses a persistent gap: environmental scanning, trend analysis, scenario planning, stress-testing, and operational strategy are often carried out in separate silos, with weak feedback loops. The Mesh connects them through multi-agent AI workflows, making foresight a continuous, iterative process instead of a one-off consultancy exercise. It also documents how futures thinking is translated into decisions, supporting transparency and accountability.  
Ethically, the Mesh foregrounds questions of narrative authority and equity. By requiring explicit equity lenses at each step, and by governing the Mesh through a cross-functional group including students and under-represented voices, the institution confronts the risk that AI-driven foresight simply amplifies dominant, Global North perspectives. The recursive design – where both data and prompts are adjusted in response to critique – turns the Mesh into a site of ethical learning as much as technical innovation.

## **Innovation Focus – Three Creative Features**

**Multi-Agent, Multi-Sector Foresight**  
Rather than a single AI model summarising HE news, the Foresight Mesh orchestrates multiple specialised agents and deliberately scans beyond higher education into public health, climate policy, labour markets, and digital rights. This creates genuinely systemic insight instead of sector echo chambers.

**Narrative and Simulation as Governance Inputs**  
The Mesh treats narrative scenarios and simulations as serious governance artefacts, not side exercises. Scenario vignettes and stress-test storylines feed directly into risk registers, committee papers, and programme review templates, closing the gap between imaginative foresight and bureaucratic procedure.

**Recursive, Value-Governed Prompting**  
The Mesh is designed to learn from its own failures. Governance groups periodically audit outputs for bias, blind spots, and unintended consequences, then rewrite prompts, adjust data sources, and re-weight domains. Prompt engineering becomes an institutional practice of values-clarification and political reflexivity, not merely a technical skill.

## **Prompt Innovation Process – Five Design Steps**

**Step A – Value Articulation Before Prompting**  
Before writing any prompts, the Governance Group drafts a short institutional foresight values charter (e.g. commitments to epistemic diversity, decolonial perspectives, and student co-agency). These values are embedded directly into all Mesh prompts as non-negotiable framing constraints.

**Step B – Role-Based Prompt Structuring**  
Prompts are designed to position AI agents in specific institutional roles (Scanner, Trend Weaver, Scenario Maker, Stress Tester, Bridge), each with clear responsibilities and limits. This avoids vague, general-purpose prompting and makes outputs easier to interpret and scrutinise.

**Step C – Equity and Absence Checks**  
Every core prompt includes explicit instructions to surface who benefits, who is at risk, and which regions, disciplines, or communities may be missing from the data. A dedicated “Equity Auditor” prompt is used periodically to review Mesh outputs and flag systematic omissions.

**Step D – Contradiction-Seeking and Counterfactual Prompts**  
The Scenario Maker and Stress Tester agents are regularly asked to generate counter-scenarios or find contradictions in their own outputs (“What would need to be true for this scenario to fail?”). This discourages overly neat futures and encourages a culture of constructive scepticism.

Step E – Human-in-the-Loop Reflection Prompts  
After each planning cycle, human users respond to short reflection prompts about how they used Mesh outputs, what surprised them, and what felt misaligned with institutional reality. These human reflections are fed back into the Mesh as training context for future prompt iterations, ensuring that the system evolves with lived experience rather than drifting into technical abstraction.

## **Creative Adaptation Challenge** 

> Re-apply the Foresight Mesh concept to a different stakeholder and sector boundary. For example, imagine a partnership between your university and a regional NHS trust, using a shared Mesh to anticipate future demands on public health education, workforce pipelines, and digital infrastructure.  
> Your challenge:

- Identify a new primary stakeholder (e.g. medical school dean, NHS workforce planner, community health organisation).

- Redesign at least two of the Mesh agents (for example, the Scanner and Stress Tester) to include data and priorities from community health inequalities, local climate impacts, or social care funding.

- Draft one new scenario that centres community perspectives and asks uncomfortable questions about institutional privilege, access, and responsibility.

- Outline how students could use this adapted Mesh in a module on health systems, climate resilience, or public policy, turning foresight into an assessed, cross-sector learning experience.

## **Closing Note** 

> This Innovative Use Case weaves together all five lessons of the chapter: real-time scanning, AI-supported trend analysis, scenario building, stress-testing, and the translation of foresight into operational strategy. By experimenting with a multi-agent Foresight Mesh, institutions can move from isolated, episodic futures work toward a living, value-governed foresight practice. The result is not merely better intelligence about the environment, but a deeper institutional capacity to think, feel, and act with foresight – alongside AI – in an uncertain world.

# Reflection & Discussion

## **Living Environmental Scanning versus Periodic Reports** 

> **Framing statement**: This chapter suggests a shift from periodic horizon-scanning reports to living, AI-augmented scanning systems that continuously track policy, technology, and demographic change. Such systems can reshape how strategy and governance are done.  
> **Reflection question**: If your institution adopted a real-time AI scanning workflow tomorrow, which existing committee processes, reports, or decision cycles would become redundant, and which new practices would you need to invent?  
> **Sample response**: An academic might argue that annual “state of the sector” papers would be less central, replaced by curated monthly briefs. However, new practices around critical review, validation, and staff capability-building would be essential to avoid superficial “dashboard governance”.  
> **AI prompt to try**: “You are a strategic analyst in a UK university. Given the description of AI-augmented environmental scanning, outline how our current committee cycle would need to change over three years to use real-time foresight responsibly.”

## **From Data Overload to Institutional Sense-Making** 

> **Framing statement**: Generative AI promises to filter overwhelming data streams into trends and implications, but it can also tempt institutions into ‘outsourcing thinking’ to models. The chapter stresses human–AI collaboration as a safeguard.  
> **Reflection question**: Where is the line between AI as a helpful lens on complexity and AI as an unexamined authority shaping institutional sense-making?  
> **Sample response**: An academic might note that AI can surface patterns across policy, funding, and pedagogy, but interpretive authority must remain with diverse human groups. Otherwise, AI-generated summaries risk becoming the de facto “truth” in busy governance spaces.  
> **AI prompt to try**: “Act as a critical friend for a university executive team. Given a set of AI-generated trend summaries (describe two or three), identify three questions they must ask before accepting these trends into formal strategic planning.”

## **Bias, Blind Spots, and Trend Dominance** 

> **Framing statement**: The chapter highlights that AI-driven trend analysis often amplifies dominant, English-language and Global North narratives. This shapes which futures appear ‘normal’ or ‘inevitable’ in institutional planning.  
> **Reflection question**: How might AI-supported foresight in your institution unintentionally marginalise particular regions, disciplines, or communities, and what counter-practices could you embed?  
> **Sample response**: An academic might argue that relying on mainstream policy portals and high-impact journals will underrepresent community-based, Indigenous, or Global South perspectives. Systematic inclusion of alternative data sources and local expertise would be needed to rebalance foresight.  
> **AI prompt to try**: “You are an equity-focused policy analyst. Given our reliance on English-language sector data for AI trend analysis, propose a protocol for diversifying sources and checking for Global South and non-dominant disciplinary perspectives.”

## **Scenario Planning as a Pedagogical Practice** 

> **Framing statement**: Scenario-building is presented not only as a strategic tool, but also as a participatory learning process that can involve academics, students, and professional staff in imagining futures.  
> **Reflection question**: What would it mean to treat AI-supported scenario planning as a core educational practice in your programme or faculty, rather than as a purely executive activity?  
> **Sample response**: An educator might suggest embedding scenario exercises into capstone modules or staff development, using AI to generate contrasting futures for assessment, research, or curriculum design. This could deepen foresight literacy but would require careful ethical scaffolding.  
> **AI prompt to try**: “As a programme director, design a 3-week module activity where students use a generative AI assistant to co-create and critique three contrasting futures for higher education in 2040, linked to your discipline.”

## **Stress-Testing Plans and the Culture of Certainty** 

> **Framing statement**: AI-powered simulations invite institutions to deliberately expose strategic plans to failure conditions. This challenges cultures that favour confident forecasts and polished strategies over acknowledged uncertainty.  
> **Reflection question**: How comfortable is your institution with making vulnerabilities and ‘near-failures’ visible through AI-driven stress tests, and what would need to change culturally for this to be normal?  
> **Sample response**: An academic might observe that many universities reward tidy narratives of success, making it hard to foreground fragility. Normalising simulation-based “red teaming” could support more honest governance, but might require reframing risk as shared learning rather than blame.  
> **AI prompt to try**: “You are advising a university Senate on adopting AI-based stress-testing. Draft a short briefing explaining why exposing weaknesses in strategic plans is academically healthy and suggesting three safeguards to prevent blame culture.”

## **Democratizing versus Centralising Institutional Foresight** 

> **Framing statement**: The chapter contrasts AI-enabled participatory foresight (workshops, cross-functional labs) with more centralised models where a small team controls tools, data, and narratives. Both carry risks and benefits.  
> **Reflection question**: In your context, would AI-supported foresight be more empowering or more centralising, and whose voices would be amplified or diminished by each approach?  
> **Sample response**: An academic might argue that accessible AI tools could broaden participation if training and facilitation are inclusive. However, if licences, data access, and interpretation remain tightly controlled, foresight may become even more technocratic.  
> **AI prompt to try**: “From the perspective of a faculty learning and teaching committee, outline a model for an ‘AI Foresight Lab’ that ensures broad staff participation, transparent methods, and protection against centralised control of narratives.”

## **Foresight–Operations Translation and Accountability** 

> **Framing statement**: A major tension in the chapter is the persistent gap between visionary foresight and operational change. AI is proposed as a ‘translator’—but translation itself can hide contested choices.  
> **Reflection question**: When AI maps scenarios to KPIs or operational plans, whose values and priorities are being encoded, and how visible are those value judgements to colleagues and students?  
> **Sample response**: An academic might highlight that choices about which indicators ‘matter’ are inherently political. AI can formalise these choices quickly, but governance mechanisms must require scrutiny of underlying assumptions and alignment with institutional values.  
> **AI prompt to try**: “You are a member of a university planning office. Given a narrative scenario about ‘AI-enabled student support’, ask an AI assistant to propose KPIs, and then critique those KPIs for hidden assumptions, equity risks, and unintended consequences.”

## **Students as Co-Analysts of Futures** 

> **Framing statement**: While the chapter focuses mainly on institutional leaders and analysts, its tools could equally position students as co-analysts of environmental signals, trends, and scenarios affecting their futures.  
> **Reflection question**: What would change if students were systematically involved in AI-assisted scanning, scenario building, and simulations about the future of your institution?  
> **Sample response**: An academic might argue that student participation could surface neglected concerns (wellbeing, affordability, local community impacts) and challenge overly managerial framings. However, it would demand careful framing, support, and transparency about how their insights are used.  
> **AI prompt to try**: “Design a student-led workshop where participants use a generative AI assistant to explore three futures for assessment in 2035, then formulate recommendations to the assessment board based on their analysis.”

## **Emerging Controversy: Algorithmic Governance of Strategy** 

> **Framing statement**: An emerging controversy is whether AI systems should directly shape institutional choices—prioritising risks, allocating attention, or recommending strategies based on simulations and trends. This raises deep questions of power and responsibility.  
> **Reflection question**: To what extent should AI outputs be allowed to steer strategic decisions—beyond advice—before we consider this a form of algorithmic governance in higher education?  
> **Sample response**: An academic might contend that AI should remain strictly advisory, with clear human accountability for final decisions. Formal policies could prohibit automated adoption of AI-generated recommendations without documented deliberation and challenge.  
> **AI prompt to try**: “As a member of a university ethics committee, draft principles for the acceptable use of generative AI in strategic decision-making, including limits on automated recommendations and requirements for human oversight.”

## **Infrastructures of Dependence and Strategic Autonomy** 

> **Framing statement**: The chapter implicitly assumes access to powerful AI models, dashboards, and automation workflows. Yet relying on proprietary platforms and external vendors can create new dependencies and vulnerabilities for universities.  
> **Reflection question**: How might heavy dependence on commercial AI ecosystems for environmental scanning, simulations, and foresight affect your institution’s long-term autonomy and capacity to set its own agenda?  
> **Sample response**: An academic might warn that vendor lock-in, opaque model behaviour, and shifting licensing terms could constrain how futures are imagined and acted upon. Investing in internal capability, open standards, and mixed-tool ecosystems could mitigate these risks.  
> **AI prompt to try**: “From the viewpoint of a university CIO, analyse the strategic risks of relying on a single proprietary GenAI platform for institutional foresight, and propose a diversified technical and governance strategy to maintain autonomy.”

# Productivity Tips

### **Convert Scanning into Weekly Programme Briefs**

**Rationale**:

Academic Programme Directors often lack time to track policy, technology, and labour market shifts. An AI assistant can distil environmental scanning into short, programme-facing briefs that directly inform curriculum tweaks, assessment design, and advisory conversations.

**AI prompt (Programme Director):** “Act as a strategic intelligence assistant for a UK university Programme Director. Using the attached environmental scanning notes, summarise three trends most relevant to my programme and suggest five concrete curriculum or assessment adjustments we should consider this year.”

**Variation – focus on one module**: “From these scanning notes, identify implications specifically for my final-year capstone module and propose three scenario-based learning activities.”  
**Variation – student-facing version**: “Rewrite the key trends as a one-page briefing to help final-year students understand sector changes.”

### **Turn Internal Data into Foresight Memos**

**Rationale**: Institutional Researchers juggle survey data, performance dashboards, and sector reports. GenAI can integrate these into foresight memos that highlight patterns, weak signals, and questions for committees, saving hours of manual synthesis work.

**AI prompt (Institutional Researcher)**: “You are an institutional research analyst in a UK HEI. Combine the attached student survey results with these sector trend summaries to produce a 2-page foresight memo, highlighting three emerging risks and three opportunities for the next three years.”

**Variation – equity focus**: “Emphasise differential impacts on widening participation and international students, and propose indicators we should track by subgroup.”  
**Variation – board-ready**: “Condense the memo into five bullet points for Council papers with clear, non-technical language.”

### **Map Scenarios Directly to Faculty KPIs**

**Rationale**: Deans are asked to consider multiple futures while still reporting against existing KPIs. GenAI can translate AI-built scenarios into KPI implications, showing which indicators remain robust and where new measures are needed.

**AI prompt (Faculty Dean):** “Act as a strategy adviser to a Faculty Dean. Using these three strategic scenarios, map out how each might affect our current KPIs, identify gaps, and recommend 5–7 revised or new KPIs aligned to a resilient faculty strategy.”

**Variation – research-intensive faculty**: “Prioritise research volume, impact, and doctoral training indicators.”  
**Variation – teaching-focused faculty**: “Prioritise student success, flexible delivery, and graduate outcomes indicators.”

### **Simulate Responses to AI Assessment Policies**

**Rationale**: Learning Technologists often struggle to anticipate how new AI-related assessment policies will be received. GenAI can rapidly simulate likely questions, objections, and unintended consequences, informing communication plans and staff development.

**AI prompt (Learning Technologist):** “You are supporting rollout of an AI-in-assessment policy in a UK university. Simulate likely reactions from students and teaching staff, identifying ten common concerns and suggesting practical mitigations and communication strategies for each.”

**Variation – disciplinary lens**: “Repeat the analysis focusing specifically on laboratory-based sciences.”  
**Variation – postgraduate taught**: “Re-run for postgraduate students balancing study with work and caring responsibilities.”

### **Scan QA Evidence for Emerging Risk Hot-Spots**

**Rationale**: Quality Enhancement Officers face large volumes of review reports and action plans. GenAI can scan these alongside foresight scenarios to spot recurring vulnerabilities, saving time and sharpening institutional risk conversations.

**AI prompt (Quality Enhancement Officer):** “Act as a quality enhancement analyst. Using these recent programme review reports and the attached strategic scenarios, identify recurring quality risks, map them to potential future conditions, and propose three cross-institutional improvement priorities.”

**Variation – assessment focus**: “Focus particularly on assessment design, academic integrity, and feedback timeliness.”  
**Variation – partnership provision**: “Concentrate on risks emerging in transnational and partnership programmes.”

### **Forecast Student Services Demand under Multiple Futures**

**Rationale**: Student Services Managers must plan staffing and support offers despite uncertain enrolment and wellbeing patterns. GenAI can transform environmental scanning and internal data into demand forecasts and early-warning indicators.

**AI prompt (Student Services Manager)**: “You are a student services manager in a UK HEI. Using these trend summaries and last year’s service usage data, sketch three plausible futures for student support demand and recommend staffing, training, and digital service adjustments for each.”

**Variation – mental health focus**: “Prioritise mental health and crisis support services in your analysis.”  
**Variation – commuter and distance learners**: “Re-run, emphasising commuter students and online learners with limited campus presence.”

### **Compress Consultations into Strategic Options Papers**

**Rationale**: Policy staff must digest lengthy consultations and produce clear options quickly. GenAI can turn hundreds of pages into tightly framed decision papers, freeing time for high-level judgement and political reading.

**AI prompt (Policy Analyst)**: “You are a policy analyst in a UK university. Summarise this government consultation and associated sector responses into a 3-page options paper, outlining at least three implementation paths for our institution with pros, cons, and key uncertainties.”

**Variation – executive summary**: “Condense into a one-page briefing for the Vice-Chancellor’s meeting with policymakers.”  
**Variation – academic board**: “Rewrite for Academic Board, emphasising implications for academic freedom, workload, and assessment practice.”

### **Model International Recruitment Pipelines Across Futures**

**Rationale**: International Recruitment Leads must plan for volatile visa, geopolitical, and economic conditions. GenAI can integrate scanning outputs into scenario-based pipeline maps, helping to prioritise markets and diversification strategies.

**AI prompt (International Recruitment Lead):** “Act as an international recruitment strategist. Using these visa policy updates and geopolitical scenarios, outline three recruitment pipeline strategies to 2030, including priority regions, risk levels, contingency triggers, and recommended diversification actions.”

**Variation – postgraduate focus**: “Focus on postgraduate taught and research recruitment only.”  
**Variation – regional campus**: “Repeat the analysis, assuming we open a regional campus in another country.”

### **Stress-Test Research Portfolios Against Policy Shifts**

**Rationale**: Research Centre Directors need to align their funding portfolios with evolving thematic priorities and regulatory landscapes. GenAI can stress-test existing grants and pipelines against different policy futures, revealing vulnerabilities and diversification options.

**AI prompt (Research Centre Director):** “You are Director of a research centre in a UK HEI. Analyse our current grants (summary attached) against these funding and policy scenarios, identifying areas of over-exposure, missed opportunities, and three strategic repositioning moves for the next funding round.”

**Variation – ethics and regulation**: “Emphasise data governance, AI ethics, and cross-border collaboration constraints.”  
**Variation – interdisciplinary pivot**: “Suggest how we could reposition towards more interdisciplinary or mission-oriented calls.”

### **Align Timetabling and Space Planning with Foresight**

**Rationale**: Operations and timetabling teams are rarely included in foresight work, yet their decisions are critical to implementing flexible, hybrid futures. GenAI can translate scenarios into concrete implications for teaching patterns, space use, and infrastructure.

**AI prompt (Timetabling / Operations Manager):** “You are an operations manager responsible for timetabling and space. Using these strategic scenarios about flexible and hybrid provision, identify implications for room types, timetable patterns, and digital infrastructure over five years, with practical planning recommendations.”

**Variation – estate constraints**: “Assume limited capacity to build new space; focus on reconfiguration and scheduling innovations.”  
**Variation – growth scenario**: “Assume a 25% increase in online and blended enrolments; prioritise recommendations accordingly.”

# Prompt Library

## Theme 1: AI-Augmented Environmental Scanning and Institutional Intelligence 

### **Designing an AI-Assisted Scanning Workflow** 

> You are the head of planning at a university. Ask an AI assistant to design a real-time environmental scanning workflow for your institution, covering policy, pedagogy, technology, demographics, funding, and sustainability. Instruct it to specify: priority data sources, automation options (e.g. APIs, dashboards, scheduled briefs), a weekly briefing format for senior leaders, and mechanisms for human verification and ethical oversight. Request the output as a clear step-by-step process plus a suggested template for the briefing.

### **Distinguishing Strong and Weak Signals** 

> Prompt an AI assistant to analyse a recent month of higher education news, policy announcements, and sector commentary (you may paste or link summaries) and classify items into “strong signals” (well-evidenced trends) and “weak signals” (emerging uncertainties). Ask it to justify each classification, explain possible implications for your institution’s teaching, research, and student experience, and propose three questions your leadership team should discuss in response.

### **Building an Institutional Intelligence Dashboard** 

> Ask an AI assistant to propose a design for an “institutional intelligence” dashboard that continuously updates decision-makers on relevant external developments. Instruct it to specify: key indicators to track, recommended visualisations, update frequency, roles responsible for interpretation, and how to integrate qualitative AI-generated summaries with quantitative metrics. Request practical examples tailored to a UK higher education setting.

### **Inclusive and Ethical Environmental Scanning** 

> Invite an AI assistant to critically review your institution’s current environmental scanning practices (you may briefly describe them) for inclusivity, bias, and blind spots. Ask it to identify whose perspectives (regions, disciplines, communities) are likely under-represented in the data you monitor, and to recommend specific steps to diversify sources, increase transparency about models and methods, and engage staff and students in challenging AI-generated interpretations.

### **From Scanning to Strategic Conversation** 

> Ask an AI assistant to turn a dense set of environmental scanning outputs (you may paste bullet points or a short briefing) into a facilitation guide for a 60-minute strategic discussion with senior leaders. Instruct it to generate: three framing narratives about “what seems to be changing,” four discussion questions that link signals to institutional priorities, and a simple sense-making activity that helps participants distinguish noise from genuinely strategic signals.

## Theme 2: Generative Trend Analysis and Foresight Modelling 

### **Mapping Global and Local Trends** 

> Ask an AI assistant to identify and compare five global higher education trends and five local/national trends that could shape your institution over the next five years. Instruct it to: briefly define each trend, explain why it matters, and suggest one early indicator you could monitor. Request a final section that highlights where global and local patterns reinforce or contradict each other.

### **Turning Data Overload into Strategic Themes** 

Provide an AI assistant with a list of reports, datasets, or newsletters your institution regularly receives (by title or brief description). Ask it to infer the main trend categories these sources collectively point to (e.g. assessment, funding, student demand) and generate a concise thematic map. Instruct it to propose how each theme could be summarised in a one-page trend briefing for your academic board.

### **Generative Foresight Scenarios from Trend Data** 

> Prompt an AI assistant as follows: “Using current trends in AI, internationalisation, funding, and student expectations, generate three distinct five-year futures for our university. For each future, describe the external environment, likely student behaviours, and dominant teaching and research models. Then identify two strategic opportunities and two risks for our institution in each scenario.”

### **Auditing Bias and Blind Spots in Trend Analysis** 

> Ask an AI assistant to critically examine how a typical AI model might misrepresent trends in global higher education (e.g. over-emphasis on English-language sources, elite institutions, or Global North policy debates). Instruct it to list likely distortions, explain how these could skew institutional planning, and recommend practical prompt strategies and data-triangulation steps to reduce these risks in your own AI-supported trend work.

### **Designing an AI-Supported Trend Literacy Workshop**

> Ask an AI assistant to design a 90-minute “trend literacy” workshop for academic and professional services staff. Instruct it to include: learning objectives, a short activity where participants use an AI tool to generate and critique a trend map, a debrief on the difference between description and foresight, and a closing exercise where participants identify one concrete action they will take in their role based on trend insights.

## Theme 3: AI-Supported Scenario Building and Participatory Foresight 

### **Framing Questions for Scenario Planning** 

> Ask an AI assistant to generate ten alternative framing questions for a scenario-planning exercise focused on the future of your institution in 2035. Instruct it to vary focus across international partnerships, digital learning ecosystems, funding models, academic labour, and student expectations, and to phrase questions in ways that invite multiple plausible answers rather than a single prediction.

1.  **Constructing a 2x2 Scenario Matrix**  
    Prompt an AI assistant to help you build a 2x2 scenario matrix for your university, using two high-impact, high-uncertainty drivers relevant to your context (for example, stringency of AI regulation and global student mobility). Ask it to: justify the choice of drivers, name and describe each of the four resulting futures, and suggest one narrative vignette (e.g. a short fictionalised student or staff perspective) that makes each future feel tangible.

### **Co-Creating Scenarios with Diverse Stakeholders** 

> Ask an AI assistant to propose a participatory foresight workshop format in which students, academics, and professional staff co-create AI-supported scenarios for the future of learning and teaching. Instruct it to describe: pre-work (including AI prompts participants might use), small-group activities where AI generates scenario fragments, methods for combining outputs into coherent narratives, and reflection questions that foreground ethics, inclusion, and power.

### **Testing Scenario Coherence and Plausibility** 

> Provide an AI assistant with a brief outline of one or more draft strategic scenarios (or describe them in prose). Ask it to identify internal inconsistencies, implausible assumptions, and areas where causal links are weak or unexplained. Instruct it to suggest revisions that improve coherence, highlight alternative interpretations, and ensure that each scenario remains challenging but plausible for a higher education setting.

### **Scenario Libraries as Living Institutional Assets** 

> Ask an AI assistant to design a structure for a digital “scenario library” that your institution could maintain over time. Instruct it to describe: metadata to store with each scenario (e.g. drivers, time horizon, authors, equity considerations), how AI tools could periodically scan new developments and flag which scenarios they resemble, and governance arrangements to keep the library inclusive, updated, and used in decision-making.

## Theme 4: Stress-Testing Plans and Linking Foresight to Operational Strategy 

### **Stress-Testing a Strategic Plan with AI** 

> Provide a brief summary of your institution’s current strategic plan (or one priority area). Ask an AI assistant to design a stress-test using three contrasting futures (e.g. economic downturn, rapid digital disruption, major policy reform). Instruct it to analyse how your plan performs under each future, identify vulnerabilities and hidden dependencies, and recommend specific adjustments to increase resilience.

### **Simulating Stakeholder Responses to Change** 

> Ask an AI assistant to simulate how different stakeholders (students, academic staff, professional services, external partners) might respond to a major AI-enabled change initiative at your institution, such as adopting AI-supported assessment or student advising. Instruct it to generate realistic concerns, motivations, and unintended consequences, and to propose targeted engagement and communication strategies for each group.
>
> **Translating Foresight into KPIs and Projects**  
> Prompt an AI assistant to take three existing foresight scenarios for your university (which you may summarise briefly) and translate them into operational terms. Ask it to propose: potential KPIs aligned with each scenario, concrete projects or pilots for the next 12–24 months, and which units (faculties, central services, committees) should own each action. Request a short commentary on which actions are “robust” across all scenarios.

### **Designing a Foresight–Operations Alignment Loop** 

> Ask an AI assistant to design a recurring annual cycle that links environmental scanning, trend analysis, scenario building, stress-testing, and operational planning for your institution. Instruct it to specify: activities and outputs at each stage, how AI tools support them, decision points for senior governance, and feedback mechanisms that ensure learning from implementation reshapes future foresight.

### **Evaluating the Quality of AI-Supported Simulations** 

> Ask an AI assistant to develop an evaluation rubric for AI-enabled simulations and stress-tests used in your institution’s strategic planning. Instruct it to include criteria for relevance, diversity of futures, transparency of assumptions, ethical integrity, and actionability of insights. Request guidance on how different committees (e.g. finance, education, research) could use this rubric to judge whether simulations meaningfully inform their decisions.

# Applying the GenAI Framework 

## Introductory Context 

This chapter explores how generative AI can support environmental scanning, trend analysis, scenario planning, stress-testing, and the translation of foresight into operational strategy. Together, these practices form a foresight “engine” for higher education institutions: sensing change, making sense of it, rehearsing multiple futures, and adjusting plans in response.

The AI Capability Framework (2026) offers a values-based way to use these tools without sliding into techno-solutionism. It asks not just *what* we can do with GenAI, but *how* and *why* we integrate it into institutional intelligence. In this exercise, you will apply the six domains to a complete foresight cycle: from real-time environmental scanning through to stress-testing institutional plans and linking scenarios to operational strategy.

You can use this section as a CPD workshop script, a postgraduate learning activity, or a facilitated team exercise. The goal is to build a shared, ethical, and practical approach to AI-augmented foresight that is realistic in busy institutional contexts, but still ambitious enough to change how your organisation thinks about the future.

## Domain 1 – AI Awareness & Orientation

## Seeing the Foresight System Clearly

### **Scenario** 

A small strategy unit has set up an AI-assisted environmental scanning workflow: n8n automations collect policy updates, sector news, and research funding announcements. A ChatGPT-style assistant produces weekly “foresight briefs” for senior leadership. The briefs are influential, but no one has explicitly discussed what the AI model knows, whose perspectives it amplifies, or how confident they should be in its summaries.

### **Practice task / learning activity** 

In cross-functional groups (e.g. strategy, academic, professional services, student voice):

1.  Map your current or planned uses of AI in environmental scanning, trend analysis, or scenario work.

2.  For each use, answer:

    - What assumptions are we making about the model (data sources, language, geography, sector focus)?

    - What types of signals or voices might be missing?

3.  Co-create a one-page “AI Orientation Note” for your foresight set-up that includes:

    - Known strengths and blind spots

    - Appropriate use cases and red lines

    - A short “health warning” to attach to every AI-generated brief.

### **Reflection prompts**

- When leadership read AI-generated briefs, what do they *think* the model is doing? How accurate is that mental model?

- How could misunderstanding model limits distort our sense of risk, urgency, or opportunity?

### **Values in play**

Transparency, humility, stewardship, inclusion.

## Domain 2 – Human–AI Co-Agency

## Designing Roles in Scenario and Simulation Work

### **Scenario** 

A university is running an AI-supported scenario planning workshop about the future of international recruitment. The AI assistant is being used to propose 2035 scenarios, generate stakeholder personas, and summarise table discussions. Participants love the speed but are starting to “vote with their prompts,” letting the model decide which futures feel most plausible.

### **Practice task / learning activity** 

Design a “Co-Agency Charter” for your next foresight or simulation exercise:

1.  Specify what AI is responsible for (e.g. first-draft scenarios, clustering themes, drafting personas, suggesting indicators).

2.  Specify what humans are responsible for (e.g. setting value frames, selecting critical uncertainties, judging plausibility, identifying equity risks).

3.  Create three “collaboration patterns” for different settings:

    - Executive retreat

    - Faculty-level curriculum foresight workshop

    - Operational risk and resilience meeting.  
      For each pattern, define when AI is used, who reviews its outputs, and how disagreements between AI output and human judgement are handled.

### **Reflection prompts**

- In your current foresight practices, where is AI overstepping into decisions that should remain human?

- Conversely, where are humans doing repetitive synthesis that could be safely delegated to AI?

### **Values in play** 

Collaboration, agency, role clarity, accountability.

## Domain 3 – Generative Practice & Innovation

## Experimenting with AI in Environmental Scanning and Trend Analysis

### **Scenario** 

A learning and teaching committee wants to understand emerging global trends in AI-augmented assessment. They set up AI-assisted trend analysis: an automation scrapes policy portals, journals, and sector blogs; GenAI clusters themes and proposes three “innovation fronts” to watch. Committee members are unconvinced, worried the outputs are either too generic or too risky.

### **Practice task / learning activity** 

Run a “Design Studio for AI-Enabled Scanning”:

1.  Using the lesson content, sketch a minimal viable workflow for environmental scanning and trend analysis in your institution (sources, tools, prompts, review points).

2.  Ask GenAI to:

    - Propose 3–4 novel scanning lenses (e.g. “student agency and AI”, “assessment labour models”, “microcredential ecosystems”).

    - Generate contrasting short briefs for each lens (optimistic, pessimistic, and equity-focused variants).

3.  As a group, prototype one concrete micro-innovation (e.g. a fortnightly AI-generated “Trend Pulse” for programme leads) and set clear guardrails (who checks it, how often, how to retire it if harmful).

### **Reflection prompts**

- How can AI-enabled scanning avoid becoming an “innovation theatre” that produces glossy outputs but no change?

- Which experiments feel small and safe enough to try this semester, and which require formal approval?

**Values in play**  
Creative risk-taking, proportionality, inclusion, learning by doing.

## Domain 4 – Ethics, Equity & Impact

## Interrogating Bias in Scenarios and Simulations

### **Scenario** 

An AI-supported scenario planning exercise generates three futures about “AI and student success.” All three, on inspection, centre English-speaking, fee-paying, campus-based students. Distance learners, disabled students, caregivers, Global South partnerships, and community partners are largely absent. The scenarios are elegant but narrow.

### **Practice task / learning activity**

Conduct an “Ethical Futures Audit” of your AI-generated scenarios and simulations:

1.  Select one AI-generated scenario (e.g. from a previous workshop or a fresh output based on Chapter 3).

2.  Identify who appears explicitly, who appears implicitly, and who is absent (students, staff groups, communities, regions, disciplines).

3.  Ask GenAI to generate an alternative version of the same scenario:

    - Centring a minoritised group

    - Framing impacts in terms of justice, accessibility, or decolonial perspectives.

4.  Compare the original and revised scenarios: list three ways strategic conclusions might differ when marginalised perspectives are centred.

### **Reflection prompts**

- What harms could arise if leadership only ever sees futures centred on dominant groups or well-resourced institutions?

- How might you institutionalise the requirement that every AI-generated scenario must have at least one equity-anchored variant?

### **Values in play** 

Equity, justice, accessibility, epistemic plurality.

## Domain 5 – Decision-Making & Governance

## Tracing How AI-Supported Foresight Shapes Power

### **Scenario** 

A governing body receives a polished pack: environmental scans, trend maps, AI-generated stress tests of the institutional plan, and a “recommended pathway” synthesised by an AI assistant from prior strategy documents. Over time, board members start treating the AI-curated pathway as the “neutral” option, even though it embeds previous power dynamics and omissions.

### **Practice task / learning activity** 

Design a governance pattern for AI-supported foresight:

1.  Map a single decision pathway where AI plays a role – for example, “Should we invest heavily in AI-enabled student support systems?”

2.  For each step (scanning, trend analysis, scenario building, stress-testing, operational planning), specify:

    - Where AI is used

    - Who has the right to question or override AI-generated content

    - What must be documented (prompts, model versions, human decisions).

3.  Create a simple “Foresight Decision Log” template capturing:

    - Options considered, futures tested, equity implications, and the final justification.

### **Reflection prompts**

- In your current governance structures, who gains influence from AI-supported foresight, and who risks being marginalised?

- How could transparent logs and participatory review reduce the risk of “AI-washed” decisions?

**Values in play**  
Transparency, accountability, participation, stewardship.

## Domain 6 – Reflection, Learning & Renewal

## Building a Living Foresight Practice

### **Scenario** 

Over three years, an institution runs multiple AI-assisted scanning exercises, foresight workshops, and simulations. Each produces impressive outputs, but they sit in separate folders, owned by different units. There is no shared memory of what was anticipated, what actually happened, or what was learned when plans were stress-tested.

### **Practice task / learning activity** 

Create a “Foresight Learning Log” for your institution or team:

1.  Identify 2–3 past or current foresight activities (e.g. COVID-era scenario planning, AI curriculum mapping, digital transformation stress-testing).

2.  For each, use GenAI to help reconstruct:

    - The scenarios or assumptions used

    - The decisions made

    - What subsequently happened.

3.  With your group, write a short reflective note:

    - What did we overestimate or underestimate?

    - How did AI tools help or hinder?

    - What practices should we formalise for next time (e.g. scheduled scenario updates, equity checks, cross-unit debriefs)?

4.  Capture these as “Design Principles for Future Foresight Work” and store them somewhere findable and shared.

### **Reflection prompts**

- If we looked back in five years, what would we want to have recorded about how we used AI in foresight today?

- How can we ensure that foresight is not a series of disconnected projects but a cumulative, institutional capability?

**Values in play**  
Learning, humility, renewal, continuity.

## Cross-Domain Synthesis Activity

## Designing an AI-Augmented Foresight Cycle for Your Institution

This integrative activity invites participants to connect all six domains into a coherent foresight-to-operations “loop” for their own context.

### **Step 1 – Map your current reality (Awareness & Orientation + Reflection & Renewal)** 

In mixed-role groups, sketch your current foresight cycle on one page:

- How do signals arrive?

- Who interprets trends?

- Where (if at all) are scenarios built or stress-tests run?

- How do insights feed into operational plans?

Annotate this sketch using Domain 1 and Domain 6 lenses: highlight where AI already plays a role, where assumptions are unclear, and where learning is lost between cycles.

**Step 2 – Design your future cycle (Co-Agency + Generative Practice)  **
Now, using the chapter content on environmental scanning, trend analysis, scenario planning, and stress-testing:

1.  Redesign the cycle for a three-year horizon, explicitly deciding:

    - Which steps you want AI to augment (and how)

    - Which steps must remain deeply human, deliberative, and value-intensive.

2.  Ask GenAI to propose 2–3 innovative but realistic enhancements (e.g. an AI-supported Foresight Lab, automated policy-risk digests, or an annual “future of assessment” scenario sprint).

3.  As a group, assess these suggestions for feasibility and ethical integrity.

### **Step 3 – Embed governance and equity (Ethics, Equity & Impact + Decision-Making & Governance) Using Domains 4 and 5:**

1.  Mark on your redesigned cycle where equity checks are performed (e.g. scenario diversification, impact assessments on different learner groups).

2.  Decide where governance artefacts (decision logs, model transparency notes, ethical approvals) must be generated.

3.  Agree on who owns the cycle overall and how diverse perspectives (students, professional services, community/partner organisations) will be included.

### **Step 4 – Commit to one concrete move** 

Each team identifies one actionable step they can implement in the next 6–12 months (e.g. piloting an AI-assisted scanning brief with an explicit equity review, or running a scenario workshop for a single programme area). They document:

- Intended benefits and risks

- Required resources and sponsorship

- How they will evaluate both AI performance and human learning.

This cross-domain task turns the chapter into a live design brief: not just imagining futures, but building the institutional muscle to work with them responsibly.

## Adaptation Tips

## Using This Exercise with Different Audiences

### **For learners/students (e.g. postgraduate education, public policy, or health programmes)**

- Narrow the focus to a single issue (e.g. “future of clinical placements,” “future of research careers,” “future of assessment in my discipline”).

- Simplify tooling: use one AI assistant plus curated documents instead of complex automations.

- Emphasise foundational literacies: interpreting AI-generated scenarios, spotting bias, and articulating their own values in relation to futures work.

- Assess through reflective essays or group presentations on “our preferred future and how to get there,” drawing explicitly on the six domains.

**For educators and institutional teams**

- Treat the six domain activities as modular workshop segments that can be run over several sessions.

- Use real institutional artefacts: current strategic plans, risk registers, committee papers, quality reports.

- Build outputs directly into governance cycles (e.g. feeding scenario insights into programme review, digital strategy, or student experience projects).

- Encourage cross-faculty participation to reflect the ecological, interconnected nature of the futures being discussed.

### **For policy or service professionals (inside or beyond higher education)**

- Reframe examples around service delivery, regulatory risk, workforce planning, or public health rather than only curriculum.

- Focus on Domains 4 and 5 to explore how AI-assisted foresight interacts with accountability, public trust, and regulatory legitimacy.

- Use the cross-domain synthesis activity to co-design an AI-augmented foresight cycle for your department or agency, with explicit public-value and equity tests.

Across all contexts, the exercise should be positioned as iterative: a starting template for developing AI-augmented foresight that can be revisited, refined, and scaled as institutional capability grows.
