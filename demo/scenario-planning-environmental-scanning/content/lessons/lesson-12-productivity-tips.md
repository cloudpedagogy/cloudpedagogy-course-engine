# Productivity Tips

### **Convert Scanning into Weekly Programme Briefs**

**Rationale**:

Academic Programme Directors often lack time to track policy, technology, and labour market shifts. An AI assistant can distil environmental scanning into short, programme-facing briefs that directly inform curriculum tweaks, assessment design, and advisory conversations.

**AI prompt (Programme Director):** “Act as a strategic intelligence assistant for a UK university Programme Director. Using the attached environmental scanning notes, summarise three trends most relevant to my programme and suggest five concrete curriculum or assessment adjustments we should consider this year.”

**Variation – focus on one module**: “From these scanning notes, identify implications specifically for my final-year capstone module and propose three scenario-based learning activities.”  
**Variation – student-facing version**: “Rewrite the key trends as a one-page briefing to help final-year students understand sector changes.”

### **Turn Internal Data into Foresight Memos**

**Rationale**: Institutional Researchers juggle survey data, performance dashboards, and sector reports. GenAI can integrate these into foresight memos that highlight patterns, weak signals, and questions for committees, saving hours of manual synthesis work.

**AI prompt (Institutional Researcher)**: “You are an institutional research analyst in a UK HEI. Combine the attached student survey results with these sector trend summaries to produce a 2-page foresight memo, highlighting three emerging risks and three opportunities for the next three years.”

**Variation – equity focus**: “Emphasise differential impacts on widening participation and international students, and propose indicators we should track by subgroup.”  
**Variation – board-ready**: “Condense the memo into five bullet points for Council papers with clear, non-technical language.”

### **Map Scenarios Directly to Faculty KPIs**

**Rationale**: Deans are asked to consider multiple futures while still reporting against existing KPIs. GenAI can translate AI-built scenarios into KPI implications, showing which indicators remain robust and where new measures are needed.

**AI prompt (Faculty Dean):** “Act as a strategy adviser to a Faculty Dean. Using these three strategic scenarios, map out how each might affect our current KPIs, identify gaps, and recommend 5–7 revised or new KPIs aligned to a resilient faculty strategy.”

**Variation – research-intensive faculty**: “Prioritise research volume, impact, and doctoral training indicators.”  
**Variation – teaching-focused faculty**: “Prioritise student success, flexible delivery, and graduate outcomes indicators.”

### **Simulate Responses to AI Assessment Policies**

**Rationale**: Learning Technologists often struggle to anticipate how new AI-related assessment policies will be received. GenAI can rapidly simulate likely questions, objections, and unintended consequences, informing communication plans and staff development.

**AI prompt (Learning Technologist):** “You are supporting rollout of an AI-in-assessment policy in a UK university. Simulate likely reactions from students and teaching staff, identifying ten common concerns and suggesting practical mitigations and communication strategies for each.”

**Variation – disciplinary lens**: “Repeat the analysis focusing specifically on laboratory-based sciences.”  
**Variation – postgraduate taught**: “Re-run for postgraduate students balancing study with work and caring responsibilities.”

### **Scan QA Evidence for Emerging Risk Hot-Spots**

**Rationale**: Quality Enhancement Officers face large volumes of review reports and action plans. GenAI can scan these alongside foresight scenarios to spot recurring vulnerabilities, saving time and sharpening institutional risk conversations.

**AI prompt (Quality Enhancement Officer):** “Act as a quality enhancement analyst. Using these recent programme review reports and the attached strategic scenarios, identify recurring quality risks, map them to potential future conditions, and propose three cross-institutional improvement priorities.”

**Variation – assessment focus**: “Focus particularly on assessment design, academic integrity, and feedback timeliness.”  
**Variation – partnership provision**: “Concentrate on risks emerging in transnational and partnership programmes.”

### **Forecast Student Services Demand under Multiple Futures**

**Rationale**: Student Services Managers must plan staffing and support offers despite uncertain enrolment and wellbeing patterns. GenAI can transform environmental scanning and internal data into demand forecasts and early-warning indicators.

**AI prompt (Student Services Manager)**: “You are a student services manager in a UK HEI. Using these trend summaries and last year’s service usage data, sketch three plausible futures for student support demand and recommend staffing, training, and digital service adjustments for each.”

**Variation – mental health focus**: “Prioritise mental health and crisis support services in your analysis.”  
**Variation – commuter and distance learners**: “Re-run, emphasising commuter students and online learners with limited campus presence.”

### **Compress Consultations into Strategic Options Papers**

**Rationale**: Policy staff must digest lengthy consultations and produce clear options quickly. GenAI can turn hundreds of pages into tightly framed decision papers, freeing time for high-level judgement and political reading.

**AI prompt (Policy Analyst)**: “You are a policy analyst in a UK university. Summarise this government consultation and associated sector responses into a 3-page options paper, outlining at least three implementation paths for our institution with pros, cons, and key uncertainties.”

**Variation – executive summary**: “Condense into a one-page briefing for the Vice-Chancellor’s meeting with policymakers.”  
**Variation – academic board**: “Rewrite for Academic Board, emphasising implications for academic freedom, workload, and assessment practice.”

### **Model International Recruitment Pipelines Across Futures**

**Rationale**: International Recruitment Leads must plan for volatile visa, geopolitical, and economic conditions. GenAI can integrate scanning outputs into scenario-based pipeline maps, helping to prioritise markets and diversification strategies.

**AI prompt (International Recruitment Lead):** “Act as an international recruitment strategist. Using these visa policy updates and geopolitical scenarios, outline three recruitment pipeline strategies to 2030, including priority regions, risk levels, contingency triggers, and recommended diversification actions.”

**Variation – postgraduate focus**: “Focus on postgraduate taught and research recruitment only.”  
**Variation – regional campus**: “Repeat the analysis, assuming we open a regional campus in another country.”

### **Stress-Test Research Portfolios Against Policy Shifts**

**Rationale**: Research Centre Directors need to align their funding portfolios with evolving thematic priorities and regulatory landscapes. GenAI can stress-test existing grants and pipelines against different policy futures, revealing vulnerabilities and diversification options.

**AI prompt (Research Centre Director):** “You are Director of a research centre in a UK HEI. Analyse our current grants (summary attached) against these funding and policy scenarios, identifying areas of over-exposure, missed opportunities, and three strategic repositioning moves for the next funding round.”

**Variation – ethics and regulation**: “Emphasise data governance, AI ethics, and cross-border collaboration constraints.”  
**Variation – interdisciplinary pivot**: “Suggest how we could reposition towards more interdisciplinary or mission-oriented calls.”

### **Align Timetabling and Space Planning with Foresight**

**Rationale**: Operations and timetabling teams are rarely included in foresight work, yet their decisions are critical to implementing flexible, hybrid futures. GenAI can translate scenarios into concrete implications for teaching patterns, space use, and infrastructure.

**AI prompt (Timetabling / Operations Manager):** “You are an operations manager responsible for timetabling and space. Using these strategic scenarios about flexible and hybrid provision, identify implications for room types, timetable patterns, and digital infrastructure over five years, with practical planning recommendations.”

**Variation – estate constraints**: “Assume limited capacity to build new space; focus on reconfiguration and scheduling innovations.”  
**Variation – growth scenario**: “Assume a 25% increase in online and blended enrolments; prioritise recommendations accordingly.”
